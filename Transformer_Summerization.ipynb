 some 30 years sooner, the sps demonstration satellite will have served its initial  purpose. the demonstration satellite represents a somewhat similar, albeit  considerably smaller, resource.  to the extent to which there develops a demand for energy, sps-like  subsystems and raw materials in space, one can expect that sps will derive some  salvage value. if, on the other hand, no such demand develops, the sps satellite will  have to be removed from geosynchronous orbit (ceo), either for storage and \\', \\'2  possible later salvage use or for permanent disposal. in this case it is important to  have estimates of the cost of sps satellite disposal.  the objectives of this study are to find potential salvage uses for. both the  sps demonstration and full-scale satellites, to determine the satellite salvage  values for each potential use, to prioritize these uses in order to determine likely  salvage value per satellite as a fraction of satellite capital cost and to determine  the cost of disposal for unsalvaged satellites or portions thereof.  1.1 background  the salvage uses and values and disposal costs estimated in this study are  based on the rockwell international sps satellite configuration and development  program. the basic satellite configuration is shown in figure 1.1 and its major  pnysical characteristics are provided in table 1.1. the satellite uses gallium  aluminum arsenide solar cells with a concentration ratio of 2 and a graphite  composite structure.  source : satellite  power systems (sps)  concept definition’  study, executive  summ4ry, ssd 79-0010-  1, rockwell inter-  national, downey, ca,  march 1979.  figure 1.1 reference satellite configuration \\', \\'table 1.1 reference satellite ctwmcteristlcs*  .;==----- =_  ys generation capability (utility 5 gu  interface)  over&l dimnsions (kl’l)  satellite ms (kc)  coyer conversion-photovoltaic  structire material  construction location  transportation  l earth-to-leo -cargo  (payload)  -personnel  (number)  l leo-to-ge0 -cargo  -personnel  (nupiber) 5.3 x 10.4  34 x 105  halas (cr = 2)  graphite composite (gfrtp)  6eo  vertical takeoff. yin6eo 2-stage  (424,000 kg)  cldoified shuttle  (75)  dedicated elect. otv  2-stage lox/lh2  (75)  microwave poker transmission  0 n0. of antennas 1  l antenna pointing/control control went gyros (cmgs)  l dc-rf converter klystron  l fre’jjency (gh) 2.45  l rectenna di=nsions (km) 10 x 13  l rectewa power density  wcl?‘)  -center 23  -edge 1  l sdurce : satellite power systems (sps) concept definition study,  executive sibwry. ssd 79-0010-l. rdckyell international. mu-  ney. ca. wch 1979.  the development and implementation program for this satellite calls for  deployment of a geosynchronous demonstration satellite, with a power generation  capability of 335 mw at beginning of life, early in the year 1999. shortly  thereafter, the demonstration satellite is grown into a full-scale satellite with a  generation capability (in space) of 9.53 cw (8.92 gw power into the microwave  antenna). the first full-scale sps satellite becomes operational late in the year  2000. following the first full-scale sps, the reference program calls for bringing  two 5 cw systems on line each year, beginning in the year 2001, until a total of 60  systems, 300 gw capacity, are installed. \\', \\'4  using the above program plan, the demonstration satellite becomes available  for salvage early in the year 2000 and full-scale sps satellites become available for  salvage at the rate of two per year beginning late in the year 2030. concurrent  with the full-scale satellites, the rectenna also becomes available for salvage. it is  possible that the rectenna will be used for a subsequent sps if the program  continues. if this is the case, some amount of refurbishment may be necessary  and/or desirable, thus allowing evolutionary changes in the satellite portion of the  system, such as beam power density, beam shape and size, frequency and  polarization. in any event, rectenna reuse may be considered to be a salvage use.  figure 1.2 shows the amount of sps materials which will have become available for  salvage as a function of time.  the utilization of geosynchronous orbit in the post-2000 time period is likely  to be quite intense. thus it is likely that any structures or satellites that are  placed in this orbit will have to be removed upon completion of their useful life.  accordingly, any unsalvaged sps-related structures, facilities or satellites will  have to be disposed of at the end of their useful life.  1.2 approach  it is clear from figure 1.2 that all salvage and disposal activities will occur in  the post-2000 time period. salvage or disposal of the demonstration satellite will  occur somewhere in the 2000 to 2010 time period; salvage or disposal of full-scale  satellites will begin sometime after 2030 and continue at least through 2060. in  order to make any estimates of salvage uses and salvage values, it is necessary to  place the potential salvage activities into the context of a space program. thus it  is necessary first to establish a mission model for the period 2000 to 2060 as a basis  for analysis. obviously any such mission model will suffer from major uncertain-  ties and, in the end, one can identify only certain long-term trends without  becoming specific about particular missions. \\', \\'1.0  0.5  0  300  200 misc.  k+p$!!  ui a s  aluminum  sapphire  copper  stainless  steel  gfrtp  2000 2030 2040 2050  calendar year  (a) cumulative salvageable mass 2060  2000 2030 2040 2050 2060  calendar year  (b) cumulative salvageable generation capacity  figure 1,.2 salvageable sps mass and generation capacity \\', \\'6  the generic trends which one can identify today that are likely to carry over  into the 21st century include mainly an t’industrialization” of space; that is, a  gradual transition from government-funded activities primarily of a research  nature to activities promoted and conducted in the private sector because they are  profitable. it is likely that these activities will be encouraged by significant  reductions in the cost of space-based activities resulting from a transition to the  space shuttle and more advanced space transportation systems, and by the  introduction and proliferation of multipurpose platforms.  much of the activity in space in the post-2000 time period will take place in  geosynchronous orbit. this activity is likely to generate a considerable amount of  low earth orbit (leo) to ge0 traffic, independent of sps. there is also likely to  be considerable other geocentric traffic, however, including leo to geo, ge0 to  ge0 and lunar traffic, as well as earth escape traffic. within the context of these  space activities, potential salvage uses for both the sps demonstration satellite  and full-scale sps satellites were identified and evaluated.  it is not clear today that the sps demonstration will be a success; that is,  that upon completion of the demonstration satellite project, it will be found  desirable to proceed with construction of full-scale sps satellites as planned. (if it  were known today that the demonstration would be successful, it would be  unnecessary.) thus salvage uses of the demonstration satellite need to recognize  that there may or may not be a continuing sps program.  on the other hand, salvage of full-scale sps satellites will occur only if there  is an sps program and, consequently, the salvage uses for full-scale sps satellites  are appropriately identified in the context of a space program which includes sps.  such a program clearly requires a space transportation system that can inexpen-  sively transport large amounts of materials to geocentric space, and it includes \\', \\'7  capabilities in large space structures, space-based construction, manned leo and  ceo facilities, and so on. these capabilities infer such space-based activities as  space manufacturing, the utilization of large applications platforms, lunar explora-  tion and exploitation, and physics and astronomy.  the above space-based activities lead to identification of the following  potential salvage uses:  demonstration satellite  0 growth into full-scale sps satellite (rockwell international reference  program plan, applicable only if the demonstration is successful)  0 use .as a source of power for other space activities such as ceo  platforms, a manufacturing base or an electric orbit transfer vehicle  0 use as a power supply for a laser space transportation system  0 use as a source of raw material.  full-scale sps satellites  0 use as spares and materials for other sps satellites  0 use as a power supply and platform for other space activities such as  platforms, a manufacturing base, a lunar base or space habitats  0 use as. a power supply for laser transportation systems including  geocentric space, especially leo to ceo, earth escape and aircraft on  oceanic routes  0 use as a power supply to recover amor and apollo asteriods  0 use as a power supply for a high-energy, high-vacuum physics labora-  tory in space.  next, the salvage value of the sps satellites was estimated for most of the  above potential uses. in all cases the salvage value is taken to be the present  value of the cost savings afforded by the salvage use referenced to the initial  operation date of the salvaged article. the discount rate used throughout this  study is a real (i.e., inflationary effects removed) rate of 4 percent. thus, the  salvage values presented represent the effective amount by which the capital cost \\', \\'8  of the satellite is reduced because it will provide a positive net salvage value. the  present value of sps revenue requirements, reflected in the sps charge’ rates, may  accordingly be reduced by this amount. for example, if it is found that the salvage  value of an sps satellite is equal to ten percent of the capital cost of the satellite,  then the annual capital carrying charge for the satellite, for purposes of com-  parison to alternative systems, may be reduced by ten percent.  any sps satellites or portions thereof which are not salvaged will, in all  likelihood, have to be removed from geosynchronous orbit. an objective of this  study is to estimate sps satellite disposal costs. to do this a number of disposal  alternatives were identified, the velocity requirements for each were estimated  and then the costs of each were determined. sps disposal costs include four  major cost categories: cost of propellant, cost of transporting the propellant to  ceo, cost of modifying the sps satellite as necessary (mainly installation of  thrusters, tankage and controls) and the cost of mission operations. cost  estimates provided are based on the assumption that the satellite is disposed of  intact.  wherever possible cost estimates used in this study were derived from the  sps concept definition study performed by rockwell international,* and are in  1977 dollars, consistent with this report. thus while these cost estimates contain  considerable uncertainty, the variation in estimates of salvage value and disposal  costs are likely to approximate the variations in satellite captial costs. hence the  estimates provided can be taken to be relatively firm when viewed in comparison  to the capital cost estimates.  7  satellite power systems (sps) concept definition study, system engineering,  part 2 (cost and programmatics, rockwell international report no. ssd 79-  0010-2-2, march 1979. \\', \\'9  1.3 results  discussion of the results is appropriately divided into four parts: salvage  value for potential salvage uses of the demonstration satellite, salvage -value for  potential salvage uses of full-scale sps satellites, salvage value of rectennae and  disposal costs for the demonstration and full-scale satellites. the major study  results are summarized in table 1.2.  two principal salvage uses for the demonstration satellite are apparent:  growth to a full-scale satellite and use as a power supply for a laser space  transportation system. obviously, the former use applies only if the demonstration  program is a success; that is, if it is found desirable to continue the sps program  beyond the demonstration phase. if this salvage use is implemented, the salvage  value of the demonstration satellite is about 80 percent of the on-orbit cost of the  salvageable hardware. since almost all of the demonstration satellite is salvage-  able (except perhaps the ion thrusters and associated systems used to transport it  from leo to geo), one can take the salvage value to be essentially 80 percent of  the on-orbit cost of the demonstration satellite. the reason that the salvage value  of the demonstration satellite is not 100 percent of its cost is because of the time  value of money (discounting) and the time delay between investment in the  demonstration satellite and start of construction of the full-scale satellite.  the second principal salvage use of the demonstration satellite, use as a  power source for a laser space transportation system, is a viable salvage use  whether the demonstration program is a success or not. the salvage value for this  use derives mainly from cost savings in the cost of transporting chemical  propellants from earth to leo for use in leo to ceo transportation of personnel  and logistics. the considerably higher specific impulse of a laser rocket permits  about a 70 percent

availability of a multi-loo.mw power  supply enables laser rocket transfer times from leo to ceo to be quite  comparable to chemical rocket transfer times.  the value of a laser space transportation system is clearly dependent upon  the amount of leo to ge0 and other geocentric space traffic. if the sps program  does not proceed beyond the demonstration phase, the bulk of the geocentric  traffic will be in support of geosynchronous platforms, providing the salvage value  shown in table 1.2. if the sps program continues into an operational phase,  however, the value of a laser space transportation system is substantially greater.  particularly with a continuing sps program, the laser space transportation system  appears so attractive that it is likely that it will be developed and used independent  of what.is done with the demonstration satellite.  many potential salvage uses of substantial value exist for full-scale sps  satellites. their value, however, is very uncertain due to the fact that these uses  occur 50 to 80 years in the future. the uses which appear to be most attractive  include laser transportation systems, both space-to-space and for aircraft on  oceanic routes, as a power supply to recover amor and apollo asteroids and,  although not quantitatively evaluated, as a power supply for a high-energy,  high-vacuum physics laboratory in space. it is conceivable that these uses, plus  other less exciting salvage uses such as power for a space manufacturing base or  space habitat, could provide sufficient demand for salvage use of an entire fleet of  60 5cw sps satellites.  the sps rectennae will most likely all be salvaged. the salvage will include  recovery of steel and aluminum which have a combined value of about $290 million  (at current prices) less removal cost plus recovery of the land. taking the removal  cost to be 25 percent of value (and adding discounting) the net salvage value of \\', \\'12  these materials would be about $67 million. it is likely, however, that the cost of.  removing the concrete for recovery of the land would be approximately equal to the  net value of the steel and aluminum. thus the principal salvage value of the  rectennae is likely to be the present value of the land referenced to the initial  operation date of the system. this is approximately $33 million* at a land value of  about $1,000 per acre.  a more valuable salvage use of the rectennae would be their reuse with new  sps satellites. in this case, especially if existing concrete footings and other  components are reusable, the salvage value of the rectennae could approach  30 percent of their new cost. since the rectennae cost represents about 26 percent  of the total sps cost of about $13.9 billion, this value could approach $1.1 billion.  if only land and the rectenna support structures are salvageable, the salvage value  is about $620 million. this lower number allows substantial evolution to occur in  the rectenna technology.  finally; those items which are not salvaged must be disposed of. the disposal  options considered and their respective costs are given in table 1.3. five disposal  options are considered. disposal to l4 or lg, the stable (equilateral) libration  points in the earth-moon system would provide a location where the satellites  might be recovered at some point in the distant future and salvaged for some,  presently unknown, use. no stationkeeping or control of the satellites would be  necessary once they are in this orbit. the second disposal option presented is to  boost the satellite to an orbit above geo. twice ge0 is presented arbitrarily.  the av required is obviously a function of how high the satellite is boosted and the  value provided is nominal. this orbit

(once every 1000 years, for  example, depending on requirements).  the third and fourth options dispose of the satellite forever by removing it  from geocentric space. these could be desirable options if it becomes important to  assure that no future concern need be given to the satellite.  the final disposal option, earth reentry, is probably the least desirable from  not only the aspect of cost --it requires the highest velocity increment--but from  environmental and risk concerns as well. this disposal mode is unlikely to be  implemented.  1.4 conclusions and recommendations  the conclusions and recommendations with respect to the demonstration  satellite are as follows. the preferred salvage use is to use the demonstration  satellite as a power source for a laser space transportation system. this will  require installation of a laser power transmitter on the satellite. accordingly it is  recommended that the demonstration satellite be equipped with both a microwave \\', \\'14 .  power transmitter and a laser power transmitter and be used to demonstrate both  sps configurations. upon completion of the demonstration, the microwave power  transmission system could be salvaged for use on a full-scale sps satellite if the  microwave sps option is found desirable. the demonstration vehicle, however,  ,would remain in ge0 and, using the laser power transmission system, power laser  rockets for leo to ceo transportation.  the value of the recommended salvage use is strongly dependent on the  continuation of the sps program, but even in the absence of a continuing sps  program, it appears sufficient to justify the development of a laser space transpor-  tation system exclusive of the sps demonstration project. for planning purposes  it is reasonable to assume that this salvage use will offset about 80 percent of the  on-orbit cost of the demonstration satellite hardware.  the conclusions and recommendations with respect to the full-scale satellites  are as follows. several potential salvage uses exist for full-scale sps satellites,  each with a salvage value ranging up to about $3 billion. preferred salvage uses  appear to be use as a power supply for a laser space transportation system, use as a  power supply for powering aircraft on oceanic routes, use as a power supply to  recover amor and apollo asteroids and use as a power supply for a high-energy,  high-vacuum physics laboratory in space.  the average salvage value of an sps satellite appears to be in the range of 5  to 10 percent of the satellite capital cost or about $500 million to $1 billion. some  specific uses, however, may provide significantly higher salvage values, but they  are likely to be limited to only a few satellites.  a basic theme which seems to dominate the salvage value results is that the  uses which utilize the entire satellite intact have a higher value than those  which require segmenting the satellite. the more the satellite is cut up, the less it  appears to be worth as salvage. \\', \\'in any event, if it becomes necessary to dispose of sps satellites, a number of  disposal options appear feasible. the cost of disposal is on the order of  $100 million. this amount has a present value referenced to the initial -operation  date of the satellite of about $30 million or only about 0.3 percent of the capital  investment cost of the satellite.  it is clear from the above analysis that an assumption of zero net salvage and  disposal cost for the sps satellites is conservative. a less conservative assump-  tion, for purposes of comparing sps to alternative systems, would be to take a net  salvage value between 5 and 10 percent of satellite capital investment cost.  1.5 backup documentation  the remaining sections of this report provide backup documentation to the  results shown above. both in review of the backup documentation and interpreta-  tion of the above results, the reader should keep in mind that the analyses and  results presented here are based upon long-range projections of space and other  activities and thus contain considerable uncertainty. \\', \\'16  2. a post-2000 mission model  oscar morgenstern once said, “predicting things is very difficult, especially  the future.” yet, if one is to establish the salvage value of sps demonstration and  full-scale satellites, one must describe the environment within which these  satellites are salvaged. at the very least, this means identifying a space mission  model for the time period during which the salvage operation will take place.  basically this time period may be divided into two parts: the years 2000 to 2030  during which time the principal object of salvage is the sps demonstration  satellite; and the period 2030 to 2060, and possibly beyond, when full-scale sps  satellites would become available for salvage.  to begin with, one should recognize that these time frames, at least in terms  of specific economic projections, are quite far in the future. the earlier time  frame begins 20 years from now and spans a period of 30 years, ending half a  century from today. the second period, beginning in the year 2030, is a period of  projection that is one-half a century and more in the future. on the scale of life of  five-year and ten-year plans, and of long-range planning that does not go beyond the  end of the 20th century, it is, for all practical purposes, impossible to develop a  mission model containing specific space missions. rather, over the period 2000 to  2030, projections of space activities are highly uncertain, although there is some  hope to identify and establish general trends. these trends can be identified on the  basis of existing technologies and technology projections for the relatively near  term. for example, an operational space transportation system based on the space  shuttle and advanced shuttle derivatives is likely to lead to reduced costs for space  activities and, subsequently, to an increasing level of commercial business in space. \\', \\'17  furthermore, there is some hope for identifying the major directions which this  “industrialization of space” will take.  beyond the year 2030, however, one’s ability to project even general trends  diminishes greatly. a fifty-year period is sufficient for major new and totally  unforeseen technologies to develop and become commercialized. without specific  knowledge of these technologies (and that knowledge cannot be had today),  projections of post-2030 space activities are entirely speculative. it is with the  above qualifications that the following projections of future space activities are  made. the first steps in making a long-range projection of space activities is to  determine where the impetus for such activities will arise. at the present time  funding for space activities derives almost entirely from national governments;  principally the u.s. and u.s.s.r. u.s. federal government expenditures on space,  spanning both dod and nasa, encompass about $6 billion for fy 1980.* looking  at free world activities and taking this $6 billion to be a measure of free world  government sponsorship of space activities and assuming, furthermore, that at the  very most this government sponsorship is unlikely to accelerate at a real rate of  growth greater than 3 percent per year, one sees a potential level of government-  sponsored activitiy in space by the year 2060 of only some ten times larger, or $60  billion per year (1980 $1, than the present amount. a space program sponsored only  by nasa and dod (assuming that they exist in the year 2060) at the level of $60  billion per year could possibly support some salvage activities on sps satellites, but  they would be severely limited.  it is highly unlikely, however, that one would be faced with the problem of  salvaging sps satellites in a space program that is principally funded by nasa and  dod, and to a lesser extent by other governments. the simple fact is that one  *the budget of the united states government, fiscal year 1980. \\', \\'18  would not be concerned about salvage of sps satellites unless an sps program is  indeed implemented. furthermore the presence of an sps program infers, in  itself, the successful development of a number of space-based technologies that  should lead to widely expanding use of space by the private sector. the transition  from federal funding to private sector funding for space activities is already  evident with communications and information satellite programs, and the accelera-  tion of these trends due to improved space transportation technologies is clearly  forthcoming. the successful implementation of an sps program assures that highly  advanced technologies in.low cost space transportation including both earth to leo  and leo to ceo will have been successfully developed. in addition, technologies  for the construction and deployment of large-scale space structures, long duration  manned facilities and low cost solar cells are assured. these technologies will be  available by about the year 2000, or at the time of implementation of the sps  system, and will thus contribute to the economic development of space in the  intervening period (2000 to 2030).  at the present time the private sector is making significant strides forward  in space-based activities with a focus on communications and data gathering.  present communications activities in the private sector include not only comsat  (a quasi-private sector organization) but a number of u.s. corporations such as  western electric, rca, ibm and so on. these activities should begin to mature  around the year 2000 with the implementation of large communications platforms  in geosynchronous orbit. both these and lower altitude platforms will also probably  be implemented by the private sector for data collection. the data collection  systems will include both natural resources and environment monitoring such as the  landsat and seasat satellites have done to date. it is conceivable that the  communications industry alone could grow to a level of expenditure of between \\', \\'19  $15 billion and $100 billion per year by the year 2060, and that data collection  activities would be on the order of $10 billion to $100 billion per year by that time.  space-based communications expenditures are likely to grow in order ‘to  handle personal communications, business data transfer and video communications  including teleconferencing. the advantages of teleconferencing in business appli-  cations are fast becoming apparent and this mode of communication is likely to  supplant a significant fraction of business travel. it is an interesting aside to note  that advanced communications activities such as this are highly energy conserva-  tive. by the year 2060 it is conceivable that between 30 and 60 large communica-  tions platforms will be in place, many in geosynchronous equatorial orbit, but some  in other orbits to serve more extreme latitudes. the present desire for geo-  stationary satellites is clearly shown in figure 2.1. by the year 1990 some 150  satellites will have served various functions, mostly communications, in that orbit.  figure 2.1 geostationary satellites--to date and planned \\', \\'20  as data collection in space becomes an economic reality, it is rapidly found  that satellites can produce prodigious quantities of data. a single advanced earth  resources satellite, for example, might produce as much as lo9 bits of data per  second. clearly, no human will ever examine all of the available data. thus it is  reasonable to expect a substantial amount of space-based data processing in order  to reduce these data to an informational level upon which decisions can be based.  space-based data processing in large (by current standards) computers, co-located  with the data collection sensors in space, thus enabling the communications link  with earth to carry minimal amounts of processed data, is likely.  an intriguing and totally unpredictable area of space activity is space-based  manufacturing. space, of course, offers a unique environment including high  vacuum and zero gravity which should be of considerable benefit to particular  manufacturing processes. the unfortunate fact at this time is that since this  environment has heretofore not been available to the private sector, the tech-  nology for using it has not been developed. as a result, to date, nasa and others  have studied a variety of products that might potentially be manufactured in space  and found that indeed there may be benefits in doing so. unfortunately there is a  considerable time lag between today and the date at which commercial space-  based manufacturing facilities will be available to the private sector. thus the  principal conclusion to which one might arrive is that there are many potential  products that could be beneficially manufacturered in space, but none of them are  the products that have been examined to date, nor are they products that one  would choose to manufacture in space based upon what is known today. accord-  ingly the annual expenditures on space-based manufacturing is highly uncertain at  this time. conceivably they could be as low as a fraction of a percent or as high  as possibly 10 percent of the gross national product, say a range of $10 billion to  $500 billion per year. \\', \\'21  the third major category of private sector activity in space is energy. if sps  is implemented, these expenditures will be quite high. for example, the operation  and maintenance expense on a fleet of 60 sps satellites will be on the order of $30  billion per year. capital construction of new sps satellites could add another $20  . billion to $50 billion or more to this amount. worldwide implementation of sps on  a large scale plus construction of space-based energy systems for lunar exploration,  asteriod retrieval and space habitation could increase this amount to as much as  $250 billion per year.  in addition to the above four categories of space-based activities, there are a  number of other activities that are likely to occur in space. these include physics  and astronomy, solar system exploration, basic and applied research, space tourism,  space-based navigation systems and so on. these miscellaneous activities are  likely to involve expenditures in the range of $5 billion to $50 billion per year by  the year 2060. summing these figures as shown in figure 2.2, the private sector  potential activities in space range from a low of about $65 billion per year in the  year 2060 to a high of about $1 trillion per year.  annual  expenditure  on space,  19806  nasa  dod  1980 2060  year private sector potential  energy $25- 2508  comm . 15-100  data 10-100  &an. lo-

space-based activities, if such growth indeed occurs between now and the  year 2060, will derive mainly from private sector ventures undertaken because they  are economic. the challenge to nasa is to focus space programs between now and  the year 2000 in such a way as to promote the economic utilization of space.  given the proper opportunities, it is conceivable that as much as 20 percent of the  gross national product in the year 2060, or say $1 trillion per year, will be derived  from space-based activities. on the other hand, without proper encouragement and  technology development from nasa and other government agencies, this amount  could be very much smaller and the government could still dominate annual  expenditures on space activities as late as the year 2060.  2.1 the period 2000 to 2030  in the context of the above discussion, it is possible to make useful  observations on space-based activities during the period 2000 to 2030. a principal  activity in space during this period will quite clearly be space-based communica-  tions, data collection and data processing. it is also evident that the current trend  of placing an ever increasing number of relatively small satellites in geosyn-  chronous orbit cannot continue. communications and data needs will be satisfied  in the future by the use of large geosynchronous platforms rather than by a number  of smaller satellites. accordingly the following general trends are identified for  the post-2000 time period:  1. space will be populated with fewer larger spacecraft. this will be  accomplished by transition to large mutli-purpose platforms.  2. bandwidth limitations will be overcome by using higher power levels  and spot beams.  3. multi-purpose platforms will not be co-located with sps due to con-  flicting requirements such as the potential need for turning sps  satellites out of the sun during maintenance periods. \\', \\'23  4. mutli-purpose platforms will occupy many important orbits, not only  geo.  5. on-orbit servicing capability will be maintained for all multi-purpose  platforms. because of their high value, downtime on these platforms  will be extremely expensive. the balance between man and robotics for  providing on-orbit servicing capability is very uncertain at this time.  6. many activities in space will be internationally sponsored, and it is  likely that large geosynchronous platforms will be considered multi-  national territory.  7. many of the activities performed in space in the post-2000 period will  be performed there because it is economic to do so independent of  government funding. these activities will thus represent a significant  transformation of space-based activities from the government to the  private sector.  8. a fully reusable space transportation system and multi-purpose plat-  forms will dramatically lower the cost of the space activities and thus  promote increasing private sector investments in space.  9. system complexity will shift from the ground segment where it is  presently to the space segment, enabling ground-based users to partici-  pate in the use of space-based communications and data collection with  relatively low investment. however this does not infer that the  majority of expenditures on a particular system will be on the space  segment. to the contrary, the lowering of costs for ground-based users  is likely to increase the number of ground-based users dramatically, thus  maintaining the preponderance of expenditures on the ground segment.  for example, if the worldwide market for personal communicators at  $100 per communicator is 100 million units, a total expenditure on the  ground,segment of some $10 billion will ensue. this might be compared  to an expenditure on the space segment in support of these communi-  cators of, say, $5 billion.  of particular interest in the post-2000 time period are geosynchronous  platforms. it has already been observed that geosynchronous orbit will be  dominated by large platforms during this period. the seeds of this transformation  have already been sown, and it is expected that during the late 80s and early 90s a  number of u.s. domestic and intelsat platforms in the 25 kilowatt class will be  placed in geosynchronous orbit. during the period of the mid-90s to about the year  2010, the placement of some five to ten larger platforms in the 100 to 500 kw class is  likely. beyond the year 2010 one can look for the replacement of the earlier \\', \\'24  platforms by a new class of platforms in the 1 to 5 mw class, growing to a total of  some 15 to 30 platforms by the year 2030. the larger platforms are likely to be  manned either by robots or by two-man crews rotated periodically. the purpose’of  man will be to effect immediate service, repair and maintenance as necessary to  keep the platform properly functioning. the cost of the advanced platforms will be  in the range of $2 billion to $10 billion each, and they will have a structure and  power supply life approaching 50 years with other systems being updated on about a  ten-year cycle.  the advanced geosynchronous platforms will be supported by a manned  geosynchronous facility which is also likely to be a space-based manufacturing  facility to manufacture and rebuild components and subsystems for the geosyn-  chronous and other space platforms. as a result it is likely that 50 to 500 persons  will be stationed in geosynchronous orbit in support of the geosynchronous  platforms.  spacecraft power and lifetime trends to date, as shown in figure 2.3, clearly  reflect these trends. twenty-five kw platforms are presently in the planning  stage* and studies on 100 to 500 kw platforms for the late 1990s time period have  ++  already been performed. the continuing improvements in lifetime and growth in  power levels shown in figure 2.3 are fully compatible with sps-based technologies.  it is interesting to consider the traffic necessary to support the geosyn-  chronous platforms that are likely to be put in place in the 2000 to 2030 period.  *  payloads requirements/accommodations assessment study for science and

materials between leo and ceo using a low-thrust electric cargo  orbit transfer vehicle (cotv). the implications in this decision indicate that the  cost of capital for the durable goods during the period of transportation is more  than offset by the cost savings afforded by the electric cotv. nondurable goods,  however, such as man and his logistics, require more rapid forms of transportation.

above. it is likely that this period will see the  widespread use of space by man including space habitation and utilization of  extraterrestrial resources. it is also likely that many scientific endeavors will move  into space: astrophysics, astronomy, high-energy physics and biological research \\', \\'27  are examples. it is this context in which salvage value of sps satellites was  considered. \\', \\'28  3. sps demonstration satellite salvage alternatives  according to the rockwell international sps development program. plan,* the  completion of the sps technology advancement phase by 1990 will provide the  technical confidence to proceed with a pilot plant demonstration phase. the  primary objective of this development phase would be the demonstration of all sps  technologies to those utility firms and consortiums that would ultimately capitalize  and operate the production or full scale operational system.  the pilot-plant or demonstration satellite will be constructed in low earth  orbit using a heavy lift launch vehicle (hllv) for mass transportation and  construction support systems. the demonstration satellite will be transferred to  geosynchronous orbit by an on-board electric propulsion system. the demonstra-  tion satellite will operate in the same mode as the full-scale sps satellite by  directing a microwave power beam at a total power level of a few hundred mw to a  standard modular segment of the proposed operational ground rectenna. the  demonstration/operational period may range from six months to a few years, during  which time the sps elements of the full-scale solar power satellite will be operated  in the operational environment. operational data will provide the quantitative  basis for analyses which will support full sps commercial capability.  the initial step will be to establish a base in low-earth orbit that is capable  of constructing the demonstration satellite. the demonstrator satellite, shown near  completion in figure 3.1, is sized to the projected electric orbit transfer vehicle  (eotv) power level of 335 mw at the array. allowing for radiation degradation  *satellite power systems (sps)

rectenna, resulting in recovery of 8 h4w of power for a sparsely  populated 7-km-diameter demonstration rectenna or 2 mw of power for a 1.7%km  demonstration rectenna.  the demonstration satellite is a single unit or bay of the operational sps  which consists of 30 such bays as shown in figure 3.2. a list of the basic items  which comprise the demonstration satellite and their related ddt&e and first unit  costs are summarized in table 3.1. the mass properties of the full-scale and  demonstration satellites are summarized in table 3.2.  because of the large investment in the demonstration satellite and the  associated transportation costs and the on-orbit capability that will exist, there is \\', \\'.w i -n-m - .__. --.-- _- .._. ----  figure 3.2 full-scale operational sps satellite configuration  (source: rockwell international)  a natural concern as to the alternative uses of the demonstration satellite upon  completion of the demonstration program, and the economic value associated with  these uses. the following sections discuss alternative uses, and the value derived  therefrom, to which the demonstration satellite may be put upon completion of the  demonstration program. four alternative uses have been considered, namely:  1. use of the demonstration satellite as the first building-block of the first full-  scale sps satellite. the economic value, or salvage value, of the demonstra-  tion satellite derives primarily from the costs which would be foregone in the  construction of the full-scale satellite through the incorporation of the  demonstration satellite into the full-scale satellite.  2. use of the demonstration satellite as a source of power for non-sps space  activities. this use requires the systematic disassembly of the demonstration  satellite and transferral and use of the disassembled power subsystems as  power supplies in other space missions. here the salvage value of the  demonstration satellite derives primarily from the costs (both hardware and  associated transportation) foregone by the other space missions through their  use of the demonstration satellite power subsystems. \\', \\'- -  table 3.1 dewonstration

orbit-to-orbit  transportation system. a laser orbit-to-orbit transportation system would  derive value through transportation cost savings primarily on the cost of  transporting otherwise-needed propellants to leo.  4. use of the demonstration satellite as a source of space-based materials. the  salvage value of this use derives from transportation costs and material costs  which may be foregone by using the basic materials existing in the demon-  stration satellite.  3.1 growth to full-scale satellite  it is currently envisioned that the demonstration satellite will consist of an  energy conversion segment, an interface segment and a power transmission  segment. the energy conversion segment will consist of primary and secondary  structure, concentrators, solar blankets, switchgear and converters, conductors and  insulation, attitude control and information management subystems. the interface  segment includes the primary and secondary structure, mechanisms, conductors/in-  sulation and slipring brushes. the power transmission segment will be representa-  tive of the full-scale satellite antenna to the extent of using identical components.  it will include structures, transmitter subarrays, power distribution and condition-  ing, batteries, insulation and phase control elements.  current plans call for growth of the demonstration satellite into the first  full-scale sps satellite. by growing the demonstration satellite into the first full-  scale satellite, certain costs may be foregone (that is, a cost item that would have  to be incurred if the demonstration satellite were not available for use, would not  be incurred since the demonstration satellite & available for use) whereas others  may be incurred. the present value of the net of these costs referenced to the  initial operation date of the demonstration satellite, is the salvage value that may  be derived from this use of the demonstration satellite. it is assumed throughout  the following that the demonstration satellite is in orbit and all associated ddt&e  and first unit costs are sunk. \\', \"-  34  the salvage value of the demonstration satellite when used as an initial  element in a full-scale satellite is summarized in figure 3.3 and discussed below.  the salvage value, sv, is  sv = pvi + pv2 - pv3 - pv4  wheie pvi is the present value of the full-scale satellite costs that may be  foregone. pvl accounts for the hardware costs for providing a capability  equivalent to the demonstration satellite capability and the transportation costs  associated with transporting this equivalent capability. the demonstration satel-  lite capability must be adjusted for degradation effects which are a function of  time (the time interval to the deployment of the first full-scale satellite) and both  hardware and transportation costs must be adjusted for learning effects (assumed  to be a function of time) that may also take place during this interim period. pv2  is the present value of consumer surplus benefits that will result if the marginal  value of  sv- sps det40 =  i i satellite \\'resent vmue of initial investment foregone  a space

consumer surplus benefits are directly proportional to the price  differential, the energy produced and the time interval from demonstration  completion to on-orbit construction of the operational satellite. pv3 is the present  value of possible increases in construction (interface) costs that result from not  being able to take advantage of knowledge gained from the demonstration program.  pv4 is the present value of the increase in demonstration satellite investment cost  to achieve the same reliability characteristics that would be achieved by the first  full-scale operational satellite. since no information is available on demonstration  satellite cost in terms of reliability characteristics, pv4 has been assumed to be  zero. the detailed value model is indicated below together with definitions of the  variables and the nominal values utilized in the analysis. it should be noted that  the annual transportation investment cost is treated parametrically and is obtained  by spreading the cost to deliver 1.618 x lo6 kg to geosynchronous orbit over a three  year period (30%, 40% and 30% respectively). the basic range of transportation  cost has been considered from 0 to 100 $/kg predicated upon the assumption that  10~ transportation costs will have to be achieved in order to proceed with an  economically viable full-scale operational sps system.  pv 1 = (iod-ioc)l1

demonstration satellite is indicated as a function of transportation  cost ($/kg) and the time interval between the initial operations dates of the full-  scale operational satellite and the demonstration satellite. the basic conclusion  that may be reached from the data presented in figure 3.4 is that the salvage value  ($l.l-$1.7 billion) of the demonstration satellite may be a large percentage of the  demonstration satellite on-orbit cost (first unit plus transportation cost). the  salvage value may be in the range of 60-90 percent of the on-orbit cost of the  demonstration satellite depending upon transportation cost achieved and the time  interval from demonstration satellite operations to operation of the first full-scale  sps satellite.  3.2 demonstration satei+

demand for space power in  the 2000 to 2030 time frame, the demand has been treated parametrically in terms  of mw required per year. this demand has been considered in the range of 1 to  15 mw/yr as illustrated by the solid lines in figure 3.5. the dashed curve in  figure 3.5 indicates the avaiiable supply, taking into account a l%/yr degradation in  power and an assumed inefficiency (25% salvage

indicates the salvage value (present value) of the demonstration sate!lite when the i  demonstration satellite is used as a source of power for other space activities such  as ge0 platforms, manufacturing bases, otv or space exploration vehicles. the  salvage value is shown as a function of the annual demand for space power and the  cost of earth to ge0 transportation. it can be seen that the salvage value is not  materially impacted by transportation costs but is directly related to demand  (mw/yr). at very high demand levels the salvage value can approach $150 -  170 million and at a demand level of less than 1.5 mw/yr the salvage value is zero.  it is possible that other major (nonpower) subsystems such as slip-  rings, mechanisms, transmitter subarray and switchgear and converters will be  salvageable for other space missions. figure 3.8 illustrates the salvage value of  the sps demonstration satellite when the power supply and several other major  subsystems are salvageable. the salvage value is shown as a function of annual  demand for power, the cost of earth-ge0 transportation and the time (relative to  2000) at which the nonpower subsystems are salvaged.*

salvage value may approach as much as $200 million when other  subsystems are salvaged and the demand for power is low.  3.3 power supply for a laser orbit-to-orbit transportation system  table 2.1 shows that whether or not the sps program moves into an  implementation phase, there is likely to be a substantial level of leo to ceo  traffic. a considerable fraction of this traffic will include man and logistics and  must be transported relatively quickly, thus prohibiting the use of low thrust,  electrically propelled orbit transfer vehicles. the presently planned mode for  providing leo to ceo transportation of personnel and logistics is to use a chemical  rocket personnel orbit transfer vehicle (potv). as table 2.1 shows, the propellant  requirements for the chemical potv are considerable. these propellants must be  transported from earth to leo. the implementation of a laser space transporta-  tion system with a specific impulse of 2,000 s could reduce the propellant mass  requirements by about 72 percent.*  assuming that propellant costs remain constant, and that the potv capital  cost and per flight maintenance costs are approximately equal for both the  chemical and laser configurations, the principal benefit attributable to a laser  space transportation system will be derived by means of cost savings in earth to  leo transportation of propellants. furthermore, it is likely that the cost of  transportation from earth to leo will depend upon whether or not the sps program  proceeds into an implementation phase. since transportation costs are a major  fraction of total sps capital costs, the transportation costs are likely to be low if  forced by sps technology development. they are likely to be significantly higher if  sps is not implemented thus alleviating much of the need to achieve low  *  laser rocket system analysis, final report, lockheed missiles and space  company, inc., nasa cr-159521, september 1978. \\', \\'47  transportation costs. at the same time, the demand placed upon a laser space  transportation system will be very much higher if the sps program proceeds into an  implementation phase than if it does not. thus the fact that the sps program is  likely to result in technologies leading to reduced launch costs, and thus to reduce  benefits for a laser space transportation system, is substantially offset by the  increased traffic that implementation of the sps would cause. accordingly the  benefits of a laser space transportation system are evaluated using as a baseline  the leo to ceo potv traffic model identified in table 2.1. earth to leo  transportation costs are assumed to be $70 per kg. a second case is also  considered using an earth to leo transportation cost of $800 per kg representative  of an advanced space shuttle or shuttle derivative vehicle.  to compute a salvage value for this use it is necessary to determine year-by-  year savings achieved by the laser space transportation system. to obtain a leo  to ge0 traffic model year by year during the period 2000 to 2030, it is assumed  that the lower bound of the transportation requirements given in table 2.1 apply to  the year 2000 and the upper bound apply to the year 2030, and that traffic growth  between these years is linear as shown in figure 3.9. the present value of savings  obtained by this traffic model, at a 4 percent discount rate, is equal to 83.8 times  the year 2000 savings.  the present value of the demonstration satellite in this use for the baseline  case with transportation costs of $70 per kg is $1.68 billion, and at $800 per kg  transportation costs to leo is $19.27 billion. these numbers, of course, are likely  to apply if the sps program does not proceed into an implementation phase. if the  .sps program proceeds into an implementation phase, the benefit from this salvage  value would be very much larger. thus it is clear that it is desirable to devleop and  implement the laser space transportation system independent of the sps program. \\', \\'48  0 i  2000 2030  figure 3.9 leo to ge0 traffic growth  since the laser sps configuration is presently under consideration, it would  appear an interesting option to include a laser power transmitter on the demonstra-  tion satellite such that demonstration tests for both the microwave and laser sps  configurations could be performed with the demonstration satellite and such that,  upon completion of these tests, the satellite could be easily converted to use as a  power supply and laser power transmitter for a laser space transportation system.  these arguments are reinforced by the fact that the benefits of a laser space  transportation system are of sufficient magnitude to warrant its development even  if an sps demonstration satellite is not constructed.  since the benefits of a laser space transportation system are likely to exceed  the costs of the sps demonstration, the salvage value of the demonstration  satellite in this use is equal to the present value of a power supply for a laser space  transportation system, discounted from the initial date of operation of the laser  space transportation system to the initial operation date of the sps demonstratjon  satellite. if this time period is very short, the salvage value of the demonstration  satellite becomes approximately equal to the cost of the demonstration program  less the cost of the microwave transmitting antenna and associated systems. these  equipments, however, could be salvaged for use on the first full-scale sps satellite, \\', \\'49  provided that the program enters an implementation phase.  3.4 source of space-based materials  a potential use of the sps demonstration satellite is as a source of materials  conveniently located in geosynchronous orbit. in this salvage use the demon-  stration satellite would be cut up into small sections, possibly melted down and  reused as raw materials for space-based manufacturing processes. this salvage use  is considered in more detail in section 4.6 relative to full-scale sps satellites. it is  found that the value of the raw materials which make up the demonstration  satellite is relatively small, roughly on the order of $157 million. the fact that  these materials are located in geosynchronous orbit, however, adds an incremental  value of about $50 million (at sps transportation costs, 50,08o$/mt), bringing their  on-orbit value up to approximately $217 million. unfortunately not all of the  materials contained in the demonstration satellite would be salvageable. the  majoi items in question include sapphire and gaas. these materials alone  constitute about 63 percent of the total on-orbit value. thus if they are not  salvageable, the on-orbit value of the sps materials decreases to about $81 million.  even so, much of this value is made up of materials which are not likely to be  easily salvaged for use as raw materials in manufacturing processes.  because of the relatively low value that the demonstration satellite has as a  source of raw materials in space, this is not a very desirable salvage option.  furthermore, the return of these materials to earth for reuse would, in all  likelihood, cost substantially more than their value on earth. \\', \\'50  4. full-scale sps satellite salvage alternatives  starting in the year 2001 and continuing through the year 2030, two full-scale’  sps satellites will become operational each year in addition to a full-scale sps  satellite becomming operational in the year 2000. the full-scale satellite  characteristics are summarized in tables 1.1 and 3.2. current plans call for these  satellites remaining in operation for a period of 30 years at which time they will be  taken out of service. when this occurs it is likely that major portions of the full-  scale satellites will prove useful in other space activities. the full-scale sps  satellites will thus have a salvage value that is related to their value when used in  other space activities. the salvage value, as measured by costs that will be  foregone because of the use of full-scale sps satellites, will derive from the use of  the full-scale satellites:  1. in a continuing sps program (termed “sps reuse”)  2. as a source of power for non-sps space activities  3. as a power supply for a laser orbit-to-orbit transportation system  4. as a power supply for laser propelled aircraft  5. as a source of power for accomplishing asteroid capture and mining  6. as a source of space-based materials.  these potential uses and the derived salvage value of the full-scale satellites are  discussed in the following paragraphs.  4.1 salvage for sps reuse  the full-scale operational satellite consists of a power generation system  utilizing gallium aluminum arsenide (caalas) solar cells with a concentration ratio  of two; an attitude control/station keeping system utilizing argon ion thrusters; a \\', \\'51  power distribution system consisting of switchgear and converters; conductors and  insulation; structure; a microwave power transmission system including waveguides  and klystrons for converting dc to rf energy; a structure system comprised of  aluminum and graphite fiber reinforced thermal plastic and an information  management system. the components, subsystems and systems are designed such  that 5 gw of power are delivered at the utility interface. to accomplish this in an  economic manner, certain systems are designed to achieve a life of 30 years (for  example, the graphite structure), whereas other systems may achieve shorter  useful lives and must be maintained and/or replaced periodically during the 30 year  life of the full-scale satellite (for example, the klystrons will be replaced at ten  year intervals). it is obvious that such a complex system will not completely  deteriorate instantaneously at the end of 30 years but will continue to function in a  degrading fashion for some time beyond its design life. thus certain systems may  be salvageable for use in other full-scale sps operational satellites or a full-scale  satellite may continue to be utilized beyond its 30 year nominal life. the actual  life, including specific maintenance/replacement policies, will be determined as a  result of the overall system economics, evolving design and design philosophy, and  operational procedures all of which have been considered in insufficient detail at  this time to specifically establish which components/subsystem/system mainte-  nance/repair procedures and policies* will be accomplished and which com-  ponents/subsystems/systems will be economically salvageable.  +  it should be noted that these policies and procedures will be a function of  technology and improvements in reliability. for example, if klystrons have a  ten-year life, then they will be replaced twice and have little salvage value  at the end of 30 years. if, however, klystrons achieve a 14-year life, the sps  satellite may have a 28-year life with one klystron replacement, or it may  have a 30-year life with economically salvageable klystrons (for other sps  satellites). \\', \\'52  the salvage value of reuse of components of a, full-scale sps satellite  depends upon which specific components, subsystems and systems are available for  reuse at the end of the 30-year life of the satellite. to determine specifically  which l’piecesvv will be available requires a detailed reliability/replacement/repair  analysis which has not yet been accomplished.  in the absence of such an analysis only a rough estimate of value may be  accomplished by considering the value of extending the useful life of a full-scale  satellite. the value of extending the useful life may be established as the  difference in the present value of the cost of a series of full-scale satellites which  become operational at 30-year intervals and the present value of the cost of a  series of full-scale satellites which become operational at 30 + at year intervals.  with a real discount rate of 4 percent, a one year (at = 1) increase in life  corresponds to a salvage value of 2-3 percent of the satellite cost. this increases  to 17 percent of the satellite cost when at = 10 years.  4.2 power supply for non-sps space activities  in the same manner that the demonstration sps satellite was viewed as a  potential source of power (335 mw) for other space activities, so may the full-scale  satellite be considered as a potential source’ of power (9.52 cw) for other space  activities. the salvage value will depend upon the demand for power created by  other space activities. the supply of power will be incremented by up to 19 gw  per year, starting in the year 2030, and decremented by the rate of degradation of  the power supplies. since a mission model for non-sps activities cannot be  established for the mid-21st century, it is not reasonable to compare supply and  demand (as was done for the demonstration sps satellite--see section 3.2) to  establish the salvage value in terms of the demand for space power satisfied by the  sps satelites. it is likely, however, that the supply will far exceed the demand. at \\', \\'53  an annual (new capacity) demand growth of 15 mw/yr, a maximum of 450 mw will  be supplied by an sps satellite if it lasts 30 years beyond its useful life. since this is  but a small percentage of the.design power level of the full-scale satellite, it may  be concluded that the salvage value derived from this use will be a small  percentage of the cost of one full-scale sps satellite.  4.3 power supply for a -to-orbit transportation system  as in the case of the demonstration satellite, an interesting potential salvage  use of full-scale sps satellites is as a power supply for a laser orbit-to-orbit  transportation system. the economics of this use are quite similar to the  demonstration satellite case; however, the full-scale satellite provides some 30  times more power and would thus be appropriate for use with much larger and  higher payload vehicles. the benefits of this salvage use are strongly dependent  upon geocentric traffic in the post-2030 period. they could be considerable if  there are massive manned activities in space, such as large manufacturing bases,  space habitats and so on. alternatively the benefits could be quite small if the  traffic remains relatively small. at this point in time the only traffic that would  clearly exist beyond that noted in table 2.1 is the traffic necessary to support the  construction and maintenance of the sps fleet. this traffic, as envisioned by  rockwell international, would involve on the order of 150 potv flights per year or  one every other day. this level of traffic can be supported by a power supply  which is on the order of hundreds of megawatts rather than gigawatts. the  advantage of a multi-gigawatt system would be to allow higher thrust levels,  possibly higher specific impulse and possibly to provide power for ascent from  earth-to-leo. unless the earth to leo traffic becomes a major factor, or unless  it becomes desirable to station satellites to provide a capability for continuous or  unconstrained thrusting, it does not appear that this salvage use will require more \\', \\'54  than one full-scale sps satellite. because of the speculative nature of the benefits  resulting from this salvage use, they are not quantified further.  4.4 power supply for laser-propelled aircraft  it has been proposed by researchers at the university of washington and  lockheed missiles and space company that space-based lasers be used to power  aircraft on transoceanic flights.* conceptually, oceanic flights would be con-  ducted by means of conventional kerosene-powered jet engines for takeoff and  climb to altitude. upon reaching altitude, at some point over the ocean, the  kerosene combustors would be shut down and the aircraft provided energy from a  laser beam originating in space. energy in the laser beam would be intercepted by  a laser receiver mounted on the top of the aircraft and used as thermal energy to  power turbofan engines. upon descent the laser power would be discontinued and  the use of kerosene resumed.  it seems reasonable to base projections of the demand for power by oceanic  aircraft on the assumption that the number of oceanic flights beyond the year 2030  is equal to the current number of oceanic flights. it is furthermore reasonable to  assume that all aircraft in the oceanic regions at that point in time will be  comparable to current ‘heavy aircraft such as the dc-10 and 747. table 4.1  summarizes the current oceanic air traffic. there are presently about 3000  aircraft-hours spent in the oceanic sectors each day.  the power requirements of a wide-bodied aircraft are typified by the 747 and  dc- 10. the 747 burns an average of about 24,000 pounds per hour of fuel at cruise  and the dc-10 17,000 pounds per hour. these numbers correspond to power levels  of 133.6 mw thermal and 94.6 mw thermal respectively. thus the average energy  hertzberg, abraham, kenneth sun and wayne jones, laser aircraft, astro-  nautics and aeronautics, march 1979, pp. 41-49. \\', \\'55  table 4.1 current oceanic air traffic  region flig,hts/day hrs/flight  north atlantic

hours/day  consumption across the day is at the rate of about 15 gw. assuming a peak to  average power ratio of 2, it follows that the peak energy consumption rate is about  30 gw. further assuming an “end-to-end” efficiency (power into the jet engine  divided by power into the laser power transmission system) of 20 percent, 30 gw of  thermal energy at the aircraft requires an input of 150 gw to the laser power  transmission systems in space. thus to service this level of traffic will require 17  or more full-scale sps satellites, depending upon the extent to which they have  degraded at the time of salvage.  the next step is to consider the economics of this salvage use. taking the  cost of jet fuel to be $1.00 per gallon (roughly the present price paid by oceanic  aircraft), the cost of the thermal energy derived from this fuel is 23.5 mills/kwh.  it is this number which must be compared to the cost of sps-supplied energy.  taking the oneration and maintenance cost for the sps. in the salvage mode, to be  $200 million per year (note that in this salvage mode it is not necessary to continue  to refurbish the microwave power transmission system) and assuming that each \\', \\'56  satellite is used at 50 percent of capacity (corresponding to a peak to average load  ratio of 21, each satellite provides roughly 40.3 x 10’kwh per year. this results in a  marginal cost of energy at the satellite bus bar of 5.0 mills/kwh. again, using the  20 percent conversion/transmission efficiency, the cost of laser-delivered energy is  about 25.0 mills/kwh. thus it appears that, at the present price of jet fuel, this  salvage use does not have economic benefit.  on the other hand, however, it is likely that the cost of jet fuel will continue  to inflate at a rate which is somewhat above the level of general inflation. thus it  becomes interesting to consider the potential benefit of this salvage use at inflated  jet fuel costs. if all oceanic aircraft shown in table 4.1 made use of laser energy  on the oceanic segment, a total 1.3 x 1011 kwh of energy would be supplied each  year to these aircraft from sps satellites. taking an infinite horizon benefit  approach and a 4 percent discount rate, this would yield a cost saving benefit of  $3.3 billion (net present value referenced to the date at which the system is fully  operational) per mill/kwh cost savings obtained by the use of sps power over jet  fuel. this breaks down to a benefit of $193 million per satellite.  to continue the above example, if the price of jet fuel escalates to a level of  $2 per gallon (1977 dollars), the benefit becomes $4.2 billion per satellite.  assuming that salvage to this use would occur at the end of the satellite% nominal  30-year lifetime, the salvage value thus becomes this $4.2 billion amount  discounted back to the initial operation date of the satellite (30 years). accord-  ingly the salvage value for this use, assuming $2 per gallon jet fuel, is $1.3 billion  per satellite.  it is interesting to note as an aside that this sps satellite salvage use would  make use of orbital positions over the ocean as opposed to over the continents and  thus would not conflict with operational sps satellites. \\', \\'57  4.5 asteroid capture and mining  it has been proposed by brian o’leary* that amor and apollo asteroids could  be captured and placed into earth orbit to provide a source of raw materials for  various space activities. typical characteristics of amor and apollo asteroids are  shown in table 4.2. the estimated population of these asteroids greater than 100  m in diameter is about 150,000. they are presently being discovered at the rate of 2  to 3 per year. the apollo and amor asteroids appear to be typical of ordinary and  carbonaceous chondrites and contain a number of free metals including nickle, iron,  gold, silver, platinum and so on. they are located in orbits close to that of the  earth and require only about 3 km/s velocity increment for capture.  o’leary proposes the use of a mass driver that is capable of using asteroidial  material to provide the necessary impulse for asteroid capture. this mode of  capture would consume a significant fraction of the asteroid. another mode, that  examined here, proposes the use of argon propellant at 10,000 s specific impulse  and the use of the sps satellite as a power supply to effect asteroid capture. taking  a av of 3 km/s each way and a 100 m diameter asteroid, 1.25 million mt, the  propellant requirements are 2,300 mt outbound and 39,100 mt inbound for a total  of 41,400 mt. using this trajectory mode, a thrust duration of somewhat in excess  of one year is required to impart the av with the asteroid in tow.  the economics of asteroid recovery depend strongly on the materials  contained in the asteroid and the demand for these materials in space. typical  values of iron and nickle contained in a 100 m diameter asteroid are as follows: a  10 percent yield of iron would provide 0.125 million mt with a gross value, at $210  o’leary, brian, mass driver retrieval of earth-approaching asteroids,  presented at the third princeton/aiaa conference on space

of nickle would yield 12,500 mt with a  gross value at $4,590 per mt of $57 million on the earth or $683 million at  geosynchronous orbit. beyond iron and nickle the total value of an asteroid will  depend strongly on the quantities of rare materials which it contains. sizeable  deposits of silver, gold, platinum, rhodium, osmium, etc. could drive the total value  of the asteroid up substantially. but the quantities of these materials likely to be  found in any particular asteroid are highly uncertain at the present time.  conceivably, the value of a 100 m diameter asteroid in geosynchronous orbit could  be as high as $10 billion. however, much lower values are likely, especially due to  the fact that there would not exist an on-orbit demand for all of the metals which  the asteroid contains. \", \\'59  the value of the materials contained in an asteroid located in geosynchronous  orbit must be compared to the cost of recovering the asteroid. the cost of  providing sufficient propellants (assuming the trajectory mode stated) ‘at geosyn-  chronous orbit, is approximately $2.1 billion. it follows that the total cost of an  asteroid recovery mission would be on the order of $2.5 billion to $3 billion.  consequently, if the net on-orbit value of the minerals recovered from the asteroid  is on the order of $7 billion to $8 billion, the net salvage value of sps used for an  asteroid recovery mission would be on the order of $1 billion to $2 billion (after  discounting).  4.6 source of space-based materials  if no salvage uses can be found for a particular sps satellite, its subsystems  or components, that satellite may nonetheless be salvaged as raw materials for use  in space-based manufacturing processes. table 4.3 summarizes the materials  contained in a full-scale sps satellite. while the total value of these materials is  approximately $4.5 billion on the earth, most of this value is contained in the  sapphire and caas which make up the solar array blanket. the major metals  contained in the satellite have a value on earth of only $205 million. in  geosynchronous orbit, accounting for cost of transportation, these materials would  have a value of approximately $1 billion. thus, depending upon the demand for  their use in space, these materials could have reasonably significant salvage value.  however it is unlikely that any but very special materials such as silver could be  economically transported back to earth for terrestrial reuse.  two satellite materials, sapphire and caas, which contain over 60 percent of  the total on-orbit value of sps satellite materials, present an interesting salvage  possibility. thus if there is a demand for them and if they can be economically  processed for reuse in space, they would be of considerable salvage value. if such \\', \"60  table 4.3 value of sps satellite materials--gaas. cr=2  mss unit cost value value at geo*  material metric tons (kt) f/mt $ billions $ millions  6frtp

other space power requirements.  4.7 miscellaneous salvage uses  it is likely that there will be other potential applications of decommissioned  full-scale sps satellites. in the mid-21st century, space industrialization will come  into its own with the need for large space stations, high power and raw materials.  it is also likely that there will be large laboratory facilities (for example, a high  energy physics laboratory) in geosynchronous orbit. it is hard to establish a value  for salvage use of sps satellites for these activities because they do not lead to  economic activities that can be easily evaluated. for example, salvage of an sps  satellite may make the establishment of a high energy physics laboratory in space \", \\'61  viable, but the salvage value of the sps satellite in this use would not equal the  cost savings afforded since the availability of the sps satellite would.enable this  mission, not merely benefit it. accordingly estimates of salvage value for these  uses would be highly speculative and are not included here.  4.8 continued use  an obvious potential use of a 30 year old sps satellite is to simply continue  to use it as an sps satellite. since the satellite would be fully depreciated at this  time, its continued use would provide, in essence, a salvage value. the only thing  which would prevent a satellite from obtaining salvage value from continued use  would be if there is a wearout failure mode for the satellite which occurs shortly  after it has been in use for 30 years. if, on the other hand, the satellite degrades  exponentially with time at a rate 6 then the net salvage value (net of disposal costs  at the end of its economic life) is approximately given by the following equation:  eor  %= pi% 1 (1+/j+ a)l-f - (i+p+a)‘-t ]- com [ - p (i+pp - (l+p)1-t - cd (l+p)-t  3  where eois the beginning-of-life energy produced by the satellite per year, r is the  revenue generated in mills/kwh, t is system age when salvaged in years, com is  the annual operation and maintenance. cost, cd, is the disposal cost and p is the  discount rate. t is the satellite age at the end of its economic life (when revenues  equal marginal operating costs):  t= ldeor/com)  in(l+a)  for typical values of these parameters, figure 4.1 shows the continued-use sps  salvage value. clearly, for degradation rates between 0 and 2 percent, this salvage  use produces a considerable salvage value at t = 30 years. it is also clear, however, \\', \"62  pv of  salvage use  referenced  to iod.  $ billions assumes  i 0  .5 i \\\\\\\\ r = 50

that for degradation rates approaching 5 percent, the sps system will not have an  economic lifetime of 30 years. since rockwell international projects the degrada-  tion rate to be on the order of 0.5 percent per year, the present value of continued  use of the sps, referenced to the initial operation date, will be in excess of $6  billion (conditioned on the assumption that there are no sudden wearout failure  modes).  the notion of continued use can be expanded to verify estimates of salvage  value obtained by direct estimation techniques, such as those employed in the  sections above. this can be done by examining the decision to decommission an  sps satellite. at any point in time there are essentially five options: to continue  operation of the satellite; to discontinue operation and dispose of the satellite; to  discontinue operation, dispose of the satellite and replace it with a new satellite;  to discontinue operation and salvage the satellite; or to discontinue operation, \", \\'63  salvage the satellite and replace it with a new satellite. this decision and the  values associated with each alternative are shown in figure 4.2. r refers to the  annual revenues generated by continued use of the satellite, com is the annual  operation and’maintenance cost as above, cdis the cost of disposal, cr is the cost  of replacing the satellite, vs is the salvage value of the satellite and pv(*) refers  to present value. it is desirable to take the choice which has the highest present  value at the date of the decision. the resulting decision rules are shown on the  right side of figure 4.2. thus it becomes apparent that if a decision is made to  salvage the sps satellite, its salvage value should be greater than its continued use  value. this notion, once again, argues for relatively substantial salvage values  associated with annual degradation rates in the range of 0 to 1 percent per year, so  long as there exist no wearout failure modes that will occur shortly after 30 years  of system use.  dispose l replace  continue operation l dispose if  r < cow - cd > vs  l salvage if  r<c @4 + l-g vs’ vs ’ o  or if  r c co,,, vs >-cd  salvage & repuce  pv (

developed the salvage value for the demonstration satellite that  will result from its use as part of a full-scale operational sps satellite, as a source  of power for non-sps space activities, as a power supply for a laser orbit-to-orbit  transportation system and as a source of space-based materials. these applica-  tions of the demonstration satellite are summarized in figure 5.1 which indicates  their relative timing and salvage value.  the laser orbit-to-orbit transportation system utilizes the demonstration  satellite as a power source for a laser space transportation system. the microwave  power transmission system is not needed in this salvage use and is thus available  for use by the first full-scale sps satellite. the salvage value derives primarily  from cost savings in the cost of transporting chemical propellants from earth to  leo for use in leo to ge0 transportation of personnel and logistics. the  considerably higher specific impulse of a laser rocket permits about a 70 percent  reduction in the mass of propellant that must be transported to leo compared to  chemical rockets. the value of the demonstration satellite .when used in this  manner is in excess of $1.7 billion.  if the demonstration program is successful, that is if it is found desirable to  continue the sps program beyond the demonstration phase, the demonstration  satellite can be used as a component of the first full-scale sps satellite. in this  application the demonstration satellite has a salvage value of slightly less than  $1.7 billion. \\', \"dekml\\'rallon satellite

(a  component of this cash flow stream is the present value of the disposal cost, of  $0.03 billion, associated with each satellite that is not salvaged.) there are  26 full-scale satellites that are salvaged over a 30-year period in the indicated  scenario and 34 full-scale satellites that have to be disposed of. the present value  of the “sal’vage value cash flow stream” (at a 4% discount rate) is approximately  $22 billion. an equivalent annuity may be established which over the 30-year time  period (60 satellites) has the same present value as the salvage value cash flow  stream. this annuity, approximately $0.64 billion per satellite or about 6 percent  of the satellite capital cost, corresponds to the average net salvage value per  satellite. it should be noted that this value could increase substantially if salvage  uses are found for the 34 satellites that are disposed of in the scenario presented.  5.3 programmatic implications  there are two significant programmatic implications of positive sps demon-  stration satellite and full-scale satellite salvage values. the first deals with the  salvage value of the demonstration satellite. although the salvage value of the  demonstration satellite is very much smaller than the salvage value of the  full-scale sps satellites, it is probably a more important consideration from a  programmatic standpoint. the second programmatic implication deals with the  effects of salvage value upon the cost of sps-generated electricity and hence on  the perceived benefits that development of the sps concept would provide.  the implications of the demonstration satellite salvage value are shown in  figure 5.2. in advance of performing the demonstration research phase, it cannot  be known that this effort will be

demonstration satellite  salvage value  demonstration phase it will be decided to commercialize or implement the sps  technology. thus two options may be considered to exist upon completion of the  demonstration phase. these are termination of the sps program and commerciali-  zation or continuation of the sps program into an implementation phase. the  consequences of a termination or stop decision would be that the costs sunk in the  sps program, cp,l, and cl, in figure 5.2, would be lost and the beneifts of  commerialization, b sps, would not be realized. it is only through’the commerciali-  zation phase that the sps development costs would in any way be recovered  (figure 5.2(a)).  on the other hand if the demonstration satellite can be salvaged say, for  example, for use as a power supply for a laser space transportation system, this  salvage use provides a benefit, blts in figure 5.2(b), that directly offsets the sps \", \\'70  development costs, even in the event that the sps program does not continue into  an implementation phase. this effect becomes very dramatic when one reaches  the decision to proceed with the demonstration phase. at this point the net cost of  the demonstration is ct., - blts rather than cd. the difference which the term  blts makes in the decision to pursue the sps concept through the demonstration  phase is profound indeed, especially as the magnitude of blts is on the order of  80 percent of the magnitude of cd.  finally, the salvage value of full-scale sps satellites can have a strong  impact on the perceived benefits of development of the sps concept. for example,  assume that without salvage the levelized cost of power from an sps is  50 mills/kwh. assume also that the cost of power from alternative energy sources  is 55 mills/kwh. one would then perceive that a cost savings benefit to society  would obtain from the use of sps-generated energy versus alternative sources with  a magnitude of 5 mills/kwh.  if, however, the sps has a salvage value equal to 10 percent of its capital  cost, this salvage value will reduce the levelized generation costs for the sps  system by about 5 percent, resulting in a net 50 percent increase in the perceived  benefit of the sps. although it may not be prudent from the point of view of a  regulated utility to reduce its energy rates in accordance with the expected  salvage value for sps, incorporation of this value in the federal government’s  planning process is entirely appropriate. \\', \\'71  6. sps disposal  the principal articles considered for disposal in this study include the sps  demonstration satellite and full-scale satellites. these satellites may be disposed  of either intact or in varying states of disassembly depending upon the extent to  which they are salvaged prior to disposal. the demonstration satellite or sections  of it, if any, will require disposal somewhere in the time period 2000 to 2030.  unsalvaged full-scale sps satellites will require disposal beyond the year 2030.  it is important to consider disposal of sps satellites upon completion of their  useful life and salvage for further use due to the fact that the geosynchronous orbit  is a limited natural resource and must be conserved for important uses. it is  prudent in consideration of sps life cycle costs to acknowledge costs associated  with satellite disposal and consider them as a part of the capital investment in the  sps system. although sps differs from many electric energy systems in that there  appear to be a number of relatively valuable salvage uses, once it has reached the  end of its useful life there is little doubt that at least some of the sps hardware  will require disposal. placing a value on sps disposal costs is in essence a  matter of placing a lower bound on net salvage value. the data presented in this  section should be interpreted accordingly.  6.1 disposal alternatives  unlike terrestrial power plants where disposal infers physical disassembly of  the plant, structures and equipment and recovery of land for alternative uses,  disposal of sps satellites may infer simple removal of those satellites from  geosynchronous orbit to another orbit or location in space where they will not  interfere with other space activities. a number of interesting possibilities exist. \\', \\'72  first, however, it is worth noting that not all disposal options are clearly  distinguishable from salvage. for example, it may be desirable to collect sps  satellites that have reached the end of their useful life at a repository location in  geosynchronous or bit. this location might be co-located with a manufacturing  base that, over an extended period of time, would make use of the sps material.  disposal of sps satellites to a common geosynchronous location is a trivial matter  requiring only a few m/s of velocity increment and which could be accomplished  over a period of one to a few months at very little cost. this disposal option has  been discussed in part in section 4.6 and is not considered further here. the major  disposal options considered here include those shown in table 1.3; l4 or l5,  supra-ceo, moon, heliocentric orbit and earth reentry.  the l4 or lg disposal option is illustrated in figure 6.1. there exists in a two  body gravitational system five points at which gravitational forces and accelera-  tions cancel each other such that an object placed at these positions remains  stationary with respect to both of the major bodies. the five points are referred to  as libration or lagrangian points. points ll, l2 and l3 are unstable in the sense  that if the body placed there is subjected to a small perturbation from the precise  position of the lagrangian point, it will drift away or assume an orbit which  diverges from the lagrangian point. points l4 and l5, sometimes referred to as  the equilatoral lagrangian points, however, are stable. that is to say if an object  is placed near these points, it will tend to orbit stably around the lagrangian point,  at least for extremely long periods of time. thus if sps satellites were disposed  of in these locations, one could expect that they would remain there unattended,  essentially forever. the only qualification to this mode of disposal would be that it  might become desirable to lash together all of the satellites located at each of  these points in order to keep them from bumping violently into each other. since \\', \\'73  figure 6.1 lagrangian points in the earth-moon system  l4 and l 5 are located in the orbit of the moon, the energy required to reach these  point is essentially equal to the energy required to reach the moon.  in tne suprage disposal option it is envisioned that the sps satellite would  be removed from geosynchronous orbit to an orbit which is somewhat higher than  geosynchronous and from which decay or perturbation resulting in interference  witn tile geosynchronous would require a vast period of time (say greater than  10,wo years). orbits lower than ge0 were not considered as a viable disposal  option because of the fact that they would result in disposed sps satellites  snadowillg operational sps satellites. any of a variety of supra-ceo orbits,  however, are open for consideration. the orbit proposed here is two times ceo.  this is an orbit which is substantially removed from ceo but yet one for which the  energy requirements to reach it are modest. \\', \\'74  the third option is considered as a means for removing the sps satellite  permanently from space. in this option the satellite is impacted on the lunar  surface. naturally any such impact would have to be carefully coordinated with  lunar activities at the time of impact. although it might be possible to recover  some of the sps materials after impact, this is not accepted as a realistic benefit  of this mode of disposal at this time.  the fourth disposal option considered is removal of sps satellites to a  heliocentric orbit such as 0.8 au. this option removes the sps satellites  sufficiently far from the earth that they are effectively gone forever. the energy  requirement for this mode of disposal is, of course, dependent upon the heliocentric  orbit into which the satellite is placed.  the final disposal option considered is earth reentry. this disposal option  arouses some amount of interest because of the possibility of recovering some sps  materials for reuse on earth if the reentry can be sufficiently wellcontrolled.  unfortunately, however, this mode of disposal not only requires the highest energy  increment and is, thus, the most expensive disposal option, it probably is not  acceptable due to environmental and risk considerations, especially in light of the  absurd extent to which the skylab reentry risks were escalated in the media.  within each of the above disposal options there exists several suboptions.  the principal suboptions include the trajectory mode and thrust level for the  disposal mission. it is envisioned that the disposal would occur using argon  thrusters at a 10,000 s specific impulse. disposal could be by means of the last  flight of a cotv. the cotv could use its own power supply or it could be  augmented by power provided from the sps satellite. in the event that it uses its  own power, the sps satellite could be disposed of in varying states of salvage  incuding one in which essentially all of the solar arrays have been removed. in the \\', \\'75  event that the satellites are disposed intact, power from the sps satellite can be  used and propellant tankage, controls and thrusters from the cotv could be placed  on the sps satellite to provide the necessary thrust and control. in this mode it ii  likely that one would choose to use equipment that was essentially at the end of its  useful life and was salvaged from a cotv.  the rockwell international cargo orbit transfer vehicle is referred to in their  study* as an electric orbit transfer vehicle (eotv), figure 6.2. it has a dry mass of  1,000 mt and carries 670 mt of propellant. this amount of propellant is sufficient  to impart a velocity increment of 1.9 km/s to the sps satellite. thus, for the  higher energy disposal option, additional propellant tankage will be required. the  rockwell international eotv configuration includes 144 thrusters of which 20 per-  cent are spares. the present specification on these thrusters is a lifetime of  8,000 hours. this is not sufficient to complete a disposal mission that requires  more than 333 days of thrusting time. thus, for some dispsal options, longer  lifetime thrusters or additional spares may be necessary. an alternative to the use  of the eotv thrusters is the use of the attitude control and stationkeeping  thrusters of the sps satellite. sixteen thrusters are located on each corner of the  sps satellite making a total of 64 thrusters. these thrusters provide a total thrust  of 832 newtons at a specific impulse of 13,000 s. combined, these thrusters can  impart an acceleration of about 23 x 10 -6 2 m/s to the sps satellite. at this  acceleration it requires 503 days to obtain a velocity increment of 1 km/s. at this  rate it would require several years to dispose of an sps satellite by means of the  disposal options presented. however, with augmentation from the eotv thrusters,  this period of time is dramatically reduced.  *satellite power systems (sps) concept definition study, final report, vol. i,  executive summary,

thrusts also raises an issue as to specifically which  trajectory mode should be used. due to the very low thrust levels and long  thrusting periods required of electrically propelled vehicles, the trajectory mode  selected for their use generally entails continuous thrusting in geosynchronous  space, resulting in spiral trajectories as those shown in figure 6.3(a). the velocity  increment for such a trajectory is approximately twice that of the optimal, high  thrust or impulsive trajectory mode. by lengthening the mission timing, however,  as shown in figure 6.3(b), thrusting only in the vicinity of periapse and apoapse of  the transfer orbit, it is possible to devise trajectory modes where the velocity  increments required of a low thrust vehicle approach that of the optimal high  thrust transfer. thus one cannot choose a specific velocity increment for the  disposal options presented here as these require further analysis and cost optimiza- \\', \\'77  thrust arc  (no coast)

trajectory modes \\', \\'78  tion. the numbers chosen were conservatively selected at two times the velocity  increment required for an impulsive transfer. thus the velocity increment or av  numbers shown in table 1.3, and subsequently the propellant requirements to  provide those velocity increments, are probably somewhat higher than the amounts  which will be ultimately decided upon. however, this overestimate in cost will be  somewhat offset by the increase in mission operations cost due to the lengthened  disposal mission time resulting from the cost optimization of the trajectory mode.  6.2 disposal costs  there are four principal elements of dispoal costs:  1. the cost of modifications to the sps satellite to ready it for the  disposal mission. these costs include added thrusters, propellant  tankage, controls and so on. depending upon the state of salvage of  the satellite, some structural modifications for adaptation of an eotv  may be necessary.  2. the cost of propellants.  3. the cost of transporting propellants to the sps satellite in geosyn-  chronous orbit.  4. the cost of mission operations.  assuming argon to be the propellant and a specific impulse of 10,000 s,  342 mt of propellant is required for each km/s of velocity increment imparted to a  full-scale sps satellite. the cost of argon is presently $240 per mt thus resulting  in a cost of propellant of $81,960 per km/s of velocity increment imparted to the  satellite.  taking the cost of cargo transportation from earth to ceo to be $50,080 per  mt, the cost of transporting propellants to the sps satellite in ge0 is $17,102,000  per km/s of velocity increment imparted to the satellite.  the cost of modifications to the sps satellite in preparation for the disposal  mission is obviously somewhat variable. a reasonable estimate for this cost can be \\', \\'79  obtained from the assumption that the entire eotv vehicle is used on its last or  20th flight to carry out disposal missions. thus taking one twentieth of the cost of  an eotv, $690 million, an estimate of $34.5 million is obtained for satellite  modifications.  the final cost, that of mission operations, is a time dependent cost. it is  assumed here that the mission operations costs for the disposal mission are equal to  mission operations costs for eotv flights. this amount is $4.8 million per year.  using the eotv thruster packs, it requires about 62 days to impart a velocity  increment of 1 km/s to the sps satellite. thus the mission operations costs,  assuming continuous thrust operation, amount to about $818,000 per kilometer per  second of velocity increment.  combining the above costs leads to a velocity-dependent cost estimating  relationship for sps disposal cost as follows:  disposal cost = $(34.5 + 18.0 av) million.  this cost is given in 1977 dollars, comparable to the sps cost estimates. it is the  cost presented in table 1.3. in order to compare these costs to the satellite capital  investment cost, they must be discounted back to the initial operation date of the  satellite. this discount factor is (1 + p) -l where is the discount rate and l is the  satellite lifetime. taking p = 0.04 and l = 30 years, (1 + p)-~ = 0.308. thus the  present value of disposal costs referenced to the initial operation date of the  satellite are on the order of $30 million or 0.3 percent of the capital cost of the  satellite. \\', \\'80  appendix a  supporting data for value of the demonstration satellite used as  a power source for other activities  a.1 cost of segmenting the demonstrationsatellite-ckws  the sps demonstration satellite is constructed at leo and then flown up to  ceo. the construction requires 120 men in orbit for 15 months with 5-6 months  required for blanket construction. crews are changed every three months. it is  thus necessary to transport 600 men to accomplish the construction.  it is assumed that the major cost associated with segmenting the demonstra-  tion satellite is the transportation cost (earth-ceo-earth) for men and supplies.  it is further assumed that the segmenting can be accomplished at ceo without  transporting the construction facilities from leo to ceo. the efficiency of  segmentation will depend upon the size of the components/subsystems/systems that  are salvaged. since the solar blanket will be constructed in about six months it is  assumed that a total of 240 man-trips will be required to segment the power  supply. therefore:  ckws &transportation cost for 240 men plus supplies  335,000 kw  trans. cost

silane-hydrolysate binder for uv-resistant thermal control coatings  1. introduction  this project was initiated to investigate the utility and thermal control coating performance of methyl silicone resins of the type ideally represented by structure  i:  ch3  the effort was to encompass the chemical synthesis of this “laddered” methyl silicone, an assessment  of its solubility, tractability and curing behavior, and a study of its ability to be formulated in  s- 13g type passive thermal control coatings. the current thermal control coating state-of-the-art is represented by  s- 13g, which is a zinc oxide-filled formulation utilizing a hydroxyl-terminated dimethylsiloxane as a binder (structure 11):  ho 0 h  it is believed that methyl silicones would potentially be more resistant to uv-  induced yellowing that dimethylsilicones. comparison of structures i and i1 shows that the methyl silicone (i) contains fewer of the radiation-vulnerable  si-ch3 linkages, based on repeating segment size, than does structure  11. another limitation of the s-13g coating is its relative susceptibility to handling damage. the proposed methyl silicones are expected to be more highly crosslinked to result  in a substantially tougher, more damage-resistant coating. \\', \\'i  one type of laddered methyl silicone is now in limited commercial production and has been evaluated  to the extent of defining erratic cure advancement or “coasting” as a significant problem. when applied  to substrates as a thermal control coating formulation, the film progressively embrittles  to a degree that detracts seriously from its coating value. this type  of material is believed to involve direct hydrolysis and polymerization of the corresponding halosilane. the patent literature also contains reports of alkoxysilane hydrol- ysates as coating binders  [ 11 but no uv-stability data are given.  ii. coating development  the scope of this project was to develop readily hydrolyzable monomers or oligomers with appropriate functionality to result in laddered methyl silicone polymers, and to evaluate these as binders for uv-resistant thermal control coatings.  a. theoretical considerations  nucleophilic displacement reactions at silicon, which occur in polar media, have been described by sommer  [ 21 as having an sn2-like mechanism. this implies a bimolecular mechanism with backside attack by the nucleophile, resulting in simultaneous departure of the leaving group. using an alkoxysilane as the substrate and water as the attacking nucleophile the following mechanism is operative:  r  if one considers the analogous case in carbon chemistry, aliphatic ethers are not hydrolyzed under these conditions. the enhanced reactivity at silicon is generally attributed to the 3d electron participation in reducing the free energy of the transition state.  an  additional factor enhancing the reactions of si-x relative to c-x is the greater polarizability of the  si-x bond. even considering this rate enhancement, the hydrolysis of alkoxysilanes proceeds rather slowly. for the purposes of this study, the modest hydrolysis rate was exploited to generate alkoxysilane hydrolysates which remained soluble for further forma- tion into coatings.  2 \\', \\'the concept of laddered siloxane polymers is based on condensation polymerization of trifunctional monomers [3-61. the trialkoxysilanes were selected as a starting point  in  development of a controlled hydrolytic process leading to formation of linear, soluble oligomers with the potential for further crosslinking  to an infusible solid. mcneil and coworkers  [7] demonstrated, using the substrate phsi (0 ch2 ch:! och3)3, that hydrolysis leads to generation of the corresponding triol in a stepwise process:  oh hz  o i  r-si (or)3 - r-si (or)2 oh  oh  i  h2° r-si-or r-si-oh 4 i  i  oh i  oh  generation of discrete intermediates was facilitated in this case by the stabilizing effect of the phenyl ring. if one now considers a totally aliphatic system such as ch3  si (och2 ch3)3 (which would be required for uv-transparency in thermal control coatings), the intermediate silanols would be expected to exist only as transient species in a series of rather complex and competitive hydrolysis reactions:  oh or or  i i i  i i  i or or r-si (or13 r-si (or12- r-si-0-si-r  oh r {ir  - r-si-or - si-0-  (i i) i i

of triol dehydration, although structures (i) and (11) could undergo further hydrolysis/ dehydration reactions to  form other laddered methyl silicone oligomers. the hydrolysis  of triethoxysilane monomers would utilize a low-cost, commercially available starting material and would generate only ethanol  as a reaction product. this hydrolytic process under neutral conditions is somewhat sluggish, but is accelerated by acid catalysis as illustrated below:  r’ r, /  1 @\\\\\\\\ r‘ / a r,si- 0: r3 si-.o, -  a& r h  steric factors also profoundly affect hydrolysis rate. the methoxy group would present the least steric hindrance, but has the disadvantage of some toxicity [as  ch3 si (och3)3] and generates hazardous methanol as a hydrolysis by-product. the corresponding triethoxysilane is characterized by a three-fold reduction  in hydrolysis rate due to increased steric hindrance, but acid catalysis accelerates this process to an acceptable time frame for coating formulation studies.  b. silane hydrolysate development  a primary goal of this development was to establish hydrolysis conditions for formation of a soluble ladder polymer at modest temperatures (below  5ooc) without addition of solvents. implicit  in this was the requirement for a low concentration of residual ethoxy or hydroxyl groups for subsequent reaction during the crosslinking phase (when applied as a coating binder). the methyltriethoxysilane monomer was chosen for initial hydrolysis studies. this commercially available compound was purified by fractional distillation (b. 143”/760 torr) to a purity of  99.5 percent (glc) sealed in a dry, nitrogen-purged bottle and stored in the cold prior to use. \\', \\'initial hydrolysis studies involved the parameters of h20 content, temperature and catalysis while monitoring the progress of the hydrolysis via high pressure liquid chromato- graphy (hplc). the hplc measurements utilized a waters micro-bondapack c18 reverse phase column with  50/50 methanol/water as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 ml/min.  a 10-gram sample of methyltriethoxysilane (mtes) was hydrolyzed with 3 mol- equivalents of water. the initially heterogeneous mixture was stirred rapidly at room temperature and aliquots were removed as a function of time for hplc analysis. the dis- appearance of the mtes peak was monitored with time and indicated significant monomer concentration remaining after  4 hr. the hydrolysis run was then repeated using various catalysts including hydrochloric, sulfuric, acetic and para-toluenesulfonic acids, as well as sodium and potassium hydroxide, stannous octoate, and tetraethylammonium hydroxide. the basic catalysts as well as stannous octoate resulted in partial gellation of the hydro- lysate. the acidic catalysis was more effective in promoting hydrolysis without excessive crosslinking. acetic acid seemed particularly suited  to this reaction, and resulted in a modest rate acceleration as shown in figure  1. in a typical acetic acid-catalyzed run at room tem- perature, the initially heterogeneous mixture became homogeneous and crystal clear after 10 min of vigorous stirring. the mild exotherm, which accompanied the reaction, peaked as sufficient ethanol was generated to establish a single phase.  as indicated in figure 1, the mtes monomer was virtually consumed after  4 hr.  0.125  0.10  u y  k u

polymer. \\', \\'a  .l the effect of temperature on the hydrolysis rate was profound and undesirable.  a similar hydrolysis run carried out at 5ooc resulted in some gellation and precipitation of insoluble polymer. considering the effectiveness of acid catalysis at room temperature for coating binder production, further temperature/catalyst combinations were not pursued. the next step in mtes hydrolysate optimization involved the mtes/hzo molar ratio. it was initially believed that stoichiometric ratios of h20 (3 mol-equivalents of h20/ mol-equivalent of mtes) would lead to premature crosslinking and subsequent solubility problems for the hydrolysate, as well as embrittled coatings after cure, for this reason the range of 2 to 3 mol-equivalents of water was assessed first. test solutions were prepared with 2, 2.5, and 3 equivalents of h20 catalyzed with  2 percent (by weight) acetic acid, and stirred for 24 hr. the resulting clear solutions were extracted with chloroform and dried over mg2s04. the highly viscous, crystal clear residues (fig.  2) were analyzed by gel permeation chromatography using micro-styragel columns and chloroform as a mobile phase. the molecular weight data from these chromatograms are given in table  1. the polymer molecular weights increased as a function of h20 concentration, but  no gellation was detected. table  1. molecular weight data

molecular weight distribution. the liquid hydrolysates were assessed for curing characteristics by painting 3-5 mils onto clean aluminum substrates and allowing to cure for  24 hr at room temperature followed by 24 hr at 150°f. all formulations from table  1 cured to tack-free clear coatings. additional mtes/h20 ratios of 10/1.5 and 10/3.5 were then prepared and applied as coatings. the  1 o/ 1.5 ratio remained tacky following the cured schedule, indicating a defi- ciency of reactive sites  on the polymer chain. the 10/3.5 ratio cured but showed some tendency toward brittleness, which would be expected for a highly crosslinked system. thus, the mtes hydrolysate prepared at room temperatures from  2 to 3 mol-equivalents of water and catalyzed by 2 percent acetic acid was selected for further study as a binder in coating formulations.  7 \\', \\'c. coating formulation/cure studies  the coating formulation studies were carried out using a dupont ti02 identified as r-900-01. samples of this pigment were ball-milled in ethanol and sprayed onto aluminum discs to serve as  uv absorptance specimens. the uv absorptance data for this study was generated on a beckman  dk-2a spectrophotometer with a gier-dunkle integrating sphere over a wavelength range of 0.27 to 2.5 microns. the pigment was quite uv-transparent in the wavelength range of interest  (0.35 to 2.5) and had a calculated absorptance (a) of 0.17. the initial coating formulation parameters were pigment/binder ratio and coating thickness. the ti02 was freshly ball milled for 2 hr in ethanol to provide a master batch with a paste consistency. the pigment and mtes hydrolysate binder were blended until a creamy smooth consistency was achieved. the formulation was then filtered through three layers of cheesecloth and sprayed at approximately  3 mil thickness onto aluminum panels using a paasche air brush. the panels were cured for 24 hr at 70 to 80°f plus  24 hr at 150°f. the pigment/binder ratios evaluated are shown in table  2, together with bend test results. table 2. optimization of coating pigmentibinder ratio bend test  1 1 pigment/binder ratio a  10/26 12/26 14/26 16/26 0.22 slight crazing 0.21 no

area was inspected at 4x magnification and the degree of crazing or cracking was qualitatively deter- mined. from the data in table 2, it appears that a threshold pigment level exists, above which coating integrity (via the bend test) is independent of pigment content. the absorp- tance appears not to be sensitive to pigment level (the difference in observed a-values is not considered significant). the effect of coating thickness was evaluated by preparing sprayed test panels in which the number  of spray coats was varied from 1 to 10. the cured coating thicknesses varied from 0.7 to 8.7 mils. corresponding a-values were determined and the data are pre- sented graphically in figure  4. this relation then allowed the spray operator to approxi- mate, by the number of spray passes, the cured coating thickness. the absorptance was measured for each thickness and plotted as shown in figure  5. it is apparent that a reaches a limiting value of  0.17 to 0.18 at a thickness of 5 to 6 mils. these same sprayed test panels were then subjected to the conical mandrel bend test with results given in table  3.  8 \\', \\'r  figure 3. bend test specimen from conical mandrel.

that a coating thickness of approximately 6 mils is required for minimum  a! values. however, as shown in table 3, coating thicknesses above 2.6 mils are characterized by substantial loss of adherence and coating integrity. this thickness limitation  is typically observed with many coatings and a practical compromise was necessary between coating integrity and uv absorptance. since a coating thickness of 2 to 2.5 mils appeared to have good hiding power for the substrate, this was chosen as a nominal thickness for subsequent parameter optimization. the @-value at this thickness was approximately  0.2 (this is comparable to typical a-values for the s-13g thermal control coating). the condition of the aluminum substrate was assessed as a means of improving coating adherence. test panels were carefully degreased and one set was lightly wiped with a solution of ludox (colloidal silica) while the other set was primed with dc1200, a standard silane primer. no improvement in coating adherence was observed in either case. a final  5 by 12 matrix was generated to assess the effect of (1) water concentration in the hydrolysate and (2) cure time/temperature on the coating flexibility/adherence and degree of cure. the hydrolysates were formed using a range of mtes/h20 ratios from 10/2.5 to 10/3.5. the cure schedules varied from 125 to 200°f and 1 to  7 days. the resulting test panels were subjected to both the mandrel bend test and a  24 hr alcohol exposure to determine degree of cure with results as shown in table  4. these observations, although somewhat dependent upon the subjectivity of the observer, indicate certain trends. the best bend test data are found for mtes/h20 ratios  of 10/3.0 to 10/3.25 with cure schedules varying from 125\\\\\\'f/1 day to  175\"f/3 days. the 200°f cure consistently results in poor coating/substrate adhesion. this is believed due to increased embrittlement of the coating through additional crosslinking at the higher temperatures. however, these same extreme cure conditions provided the greatest resistance to alcohol attack. again, this is a manifestation of high crosslink density in the methylsilicone binder. based on the results  of  table 4, a practical coating system would reflect a compromise between coating adherence and degree of crosslinking, such as a 10/3.25 ratio cured at 150\"f/3 days. 11 \\',

formulated as a binder with ball-milled ti02 in a weight ratio of 12/26 ti02/binder. this formulation was spray- applied at a thickness  of 2 to 2.5 mils to aluminum substrate and cured 24 hr/75\"f plus  3 days/150°f. figure 6 shows a typical coating application. the uv-stability of this coating formulation was determined using a spectrolab x-25 solar simulator which simulates, within  5 percent, the actual solar spectrum over the wavelength range of 0.25 to 1.3 microns. the samples were mounted on a water-cooled plate and the test chamber was evacuated to 10-6 torr. the absorptance data were collected over a 930 hr exposure period as shown in table  5. these measurements were made in air and do not represent the worst case, since they  do not include any oxygen-bleachable damage in the ti02 pigment. table  5. ultraviolet absorptance of  silane hydrolysate coating  ~~  sample experimental coating  #1  experimental coating #2 s-13glo  #1  s- 13glo #2 to 0.20 0.23 0.20 0.20 t266

epoxy-based coatings (square samples) are also shown for contrast. the s-13glo samples were run at the same time for comparative purposes. the silane hydrolysate coating was cured for 24 hr at temperatures of  100, 150, and 175°f for outgassing assessment. the samples were tested  in accordance with the require- ments of msfc drawing 50m02442. the samples were maintained at 10-6 torr and heated from 25 to 100°c at 2\"c/min. the rate of weight loss in each case was less than 0.2 percent/ cm2/hr, which is considered acceptable for coating materials in the space environment. additional bend testing was performed to assess the coating integrity following thermal cycling. appropriate samples were subjected to the mandrel bend test, and identi- cal samples were thermal cycled from -150°f to 150°f for  5 cycles. bend testing on the cycled specimens showed  no significant increase in the tendency of the coating to craze or  crack.  13 \\', \\'figure 6. typical sprayed panel of silane hydrolysate coating. \\', \\'figure 7. test fixture with experimental coatings following 930 hour exposure. \\', \\'one of the greatest potential advantages of the silane hydrolysate coating as opposed  to the s-13glo is the significant increase in damage resistance offered by the experimental system. the cured experimental coatings were not visibly damaged by thumbnail pressure, while the s-13g was readily removed. the abrasion resistance of these coatings was com- pared on a taber abrasion tester, using  cs-io abrasive wheels with 500 grams of weight per wheel. at the end  of 3000 revolutions, the s-13g samples had lost 4 to 5 times more coating weight than the experimental silane hydrolysate coating.  iv. conclusions  this development study has led to the definition of a specific methyltriethoxysilane hydrolysate binder suitable for formulation as a candidate thermal control coating. the ease of spray application and cure under modest conditions (1 50°f/3 days) provide realistic processing conditions for flight hardware. the high inherent thermal stability and low out- gassing characteristics of the binder would appear well suited for use  on spacecraft with contamination-sensitive hardware. the uv absorptance values over 930 hr were not signifi- cantly different from those of s-l3g, indicating that the reduction in silicon-methyl group concentration along the laddered polymer chain does not reduce the uv-damage suscep- tibility (based on short term exposures) to a measureable extent. longer exposure times and in situ measurement techniques are needed to force a measurable degradation in the s-13g and assess the relative performance  of the experimental coating. the experimental coating is characterized by a substantially greater resistance to abrasion and accidental damage than the s-13glo coating. this feature together with reasonable flexibility in bending of the coating substrate, should provide a very durable coating. one of the greatest drawbacks of commercial resins with a “ladder” structure has been their tendency to “coast” or develop  a higher degree of crosslinking and subsequently embrittle with time. the flex test results on the experimental coating did not indicate a significant tendency toward embrittlement, based  on comparison of cure for 1 day or 7  days at the various test temperatures. the testing should be extended to periods of several months at various temperatures to conclusively assess the embrittlement tendency. the silane hydrolysate binder system should be investigated with pigments other than ti02. limited trials during this project with both s-13glo and zinc orthotitanate pigments (both have greater intrinsic uv-stability than ti09 indicated binder compatibility problems. similar effects in dimethylsilicone binders have been resolved by modifications in pigment surface chemistry, and further modifications should yield stable silane hydrolysate-based coatings.  16 \\', \\'references

systems by the mitre corporation, we identified an exemplar 30/20 ghz system configuration. we suggested cost-effective directions for further consideration which indicate a variation of about 30% in total system cost as a function of overall system design. key aspects of the system are the multibeam antenna and utilization of the 2.5 ghz bandwidth. we estimated that 100 mhz of spectrum would be utilized for the customer premises applications served by two scanning beams, and 2.4 ghz for the fixed users served by 40 fixed beams. in order to provide numerical discussions for the second year study of the regenerative baseband processor, it was assumed that there were eight fixed and eight scanning beams on both the uplinks and downlinks, each using the same 100 mhz uplink and downlink bandwidths. the estimated power consumption is 1 kw. with 1 b/s per hertz and 16 movable spot antenna beams, the system would have a capacity of 1.6 gb/s, which is considered sufficient to emphasize processor design concepts and device technology appropriate to an advanced concept study. for the fixed users employing the 2.4 ghz bandwidth, a separate 100 x 100 crosspoint radio frequency (rf) switch design was studied. baseband processor the second year study of an all-digital baseband processor produced a new processor architecture and provided more detailed discussions of modulation, link establishment, network and packet routing protocols, and packet design. these features are closely related to the design of the processor as well as to throughput efficiency and performance requirements of the technology. memory requirements were reduced by adopting a 1 ms frame duration of eight 125 microsecond time slots. this design also allows multiple frequency division multiple access (fdma) carriers with time division multiplex (tdm) in a fixed beam, or a number of fdma signals using a single channel per carrier during the dwell interval of a scanning beam. with the beam scan occurring once per frame, the burst rate is 8r for a data rate r, and also 8r for time 1 0\\', \\'division multiple access (tdma) users in a fixed beam. with r equal to the rate of a t1 carrier (1.544 mb/s), 8r is 12.3 mb/s and eight channels use 100 mhz (one bit per cyllc cr 1 b/s per hertz). digital demodulation requires ari-iog to digital conversion followed by high speed multiplication. various technologies can be utilized but none are developed adequately for the capacities envisioned in this system. gallium arsenide (gaas) very large scale integration (vlsi) technology appears feasible for all-digital demodulation with further development impetus. hybrid analog techniques using surface acoustic wave and charge-coupled devices were investigated, and also are recommended as serious candidates for demodulators. demodulated data can be flexibly routed using packet techniques. a link establishment protocol utilizing demand assignment schemes is used to establish links and packet routing protocols (prps) are employed for message transmissions. the two levels of protocol are worked out in detail, including five different prps. the associated packet formats are also detailed. rf crossbar switch for the high capacity trunking applications, the 100 x 100 switch architecture (microstrip directional coupler with field effect transistor (fet)) switches identified in the first year report was carried a step further toward a physical realization, and may be viewed as a more detailed organization of the switch design problem. the switch can be visualized as two parallel planes of 100 parallel transmission lines which cross with lines of each plane in orthogonal directions: each crossing represents a crosspoint which requires a directional line-to-line coupler and fet switch. this large planar 4ssembly was subdivided into cards with card-to-card cabling to maintain interconnectivity. a packaging concept of ten drawers of 20 cards each was chosen. the critical microwave design of the crosspoints was given attention. a wiggly-line coupler having 2.4 ghz bandwidth realized in microstrip has the required characteristics. a three-state fet is used as a switch. considerable attention was paid to the design and mounting of logic and its interconnection in order to minimize cabling weight, provide adequate electro- magnetic compatibility (emc) isolation, low cross coupling of 2 e\\', \"control lines, and adequate (60 db) crosspoint isolation when a switch is open. switches are controlled from a memory pattern with changes in state at timed intervals. memory is organized in three levels: (1) storage of changes in switch state for frame period, updated from ground command; (2) main control memory, pattern or menu; and (3) holding registers for each switch. minimum weight and size occur when memory is distributed to locations close to the crosspoints. actual hardware was chosen to implement logic functions in order to illustrate feasibility. the hardware design represents a benchmark of feasibility and is suitable for vlsi consideration. similarly, the latest microwave research in monolithic circuits allows weight reduction. estimated weight for the 100 x 100 switch is 387 kg. the weight was estimated by weighing some integrated circuits (ics) and other parts, but over 80% was calculated on the basis of simplistic mechanical design. consequently, a 300 tolerance must be assumed. we believe that the present design exercise has provided further credibility to the recommended approach, but that weight reduction is possible. estimated power consumption is 107 w. the 5000 double flip- flops used to control the 10,000 switch crosspoints consume 100 w of this power. 3f! \\'1\", \"iisection 2 introduction the anticipated growth in demand for telecommunications services will accelerate with the introduction or elaboration of new services (such as video conferencing and high speed computer networks). these new services together with the continuing growth in private line, video broadcast networks, and other familiar services lead to the conclusions that satellite communications will have an expanding role and that united states domestic satellite capacity achievable in the 4/6 and 12/14 ghz bands will not be sufficient in the 1990 time period. since satellite communications have proven cost-effective for domestic telecommunications, expansion of the satellite capability into the 1990\\'s appears essential. accordingly, national aeronautics and space administration (nasa) lewis research center is conducting a program leading toward development and demonstration of technology for a 1990\\'s satellite system which can expand the domestic communications capacity available from the geostationary arc. the nasa lewis program has focused on the development of a new frequency band (30/20 ghz) with frequency reuse as a central feature. this approach will provide technology for greatly extending the utility of u.s. domestic satellite communications in the 1990\\'s and beyond. system concepts devised to provide frequency reuse and high capacity incorporate multiple beam uplink and downlink antennas interconnected by either demodulat \\'remodulate processing (in which the signals are demodulated to data bits and reformated for downlink transmission) or rf switching (in which the signals are not demodulated). neither concept is strictly new, but for the applications envisioned, considerable extension of the state-of-the-art is implied. the mitre corporation has completed a two-year study of on-board processing for nasa lewis research center as an integral part of the 30/20 ghz program. this volume is the final technical report of the second year study. the first year of the mitre study considered the system context for on-board processing and provided an exemplar system description which incorporated both demodulate/remodulate digital baseband processing and rf switching. the relationship of signal waveforms to efficiency of spectrum utilization and demodulation demands required a study of modulation. in addition, network control protocols were analyzed in relation tc baseband processing and system throughput. particularly emphasized were basic architectures for large scale rf switches and baseband processors, and an analysis f 0\", \"of system performance improvements realized from processing. the first year study resulted in three reports: a detailed technical report[1]. an annotated bibliography[2] listing the results of a thorough literature survey which located 272 papers and reports, and an executive summary.[.;] the first year results concluded that significant performance gains on the order of 4 db in energy to noise ratio (e/no) resulted from demodulate/remodulate processing, and pointed towards a microprocessor all-digital spproach for further analysis. investigation of rf switch architectures led to identification of a recommended approach: a microwave crossbar realized in microstrip with feedthrough directional couplers and fets as switching elements. these concepts (digital baseband processor and rf crossbar switch) were further analyzed in the second year and results are reported in this volume. included is a more detailed and up-to-date treatment of digital technology for the baseband processor, and more detailed discussions of modulation, all-digital demodulation, network protocols relating to efficient access, and packet routing in the baseband processor. an engineering analysis of the rf switch showed how the hardware could be packaged and what power and weight would result by using existing technology. the baseband processor design is not built directly on a nasa traffic model because the regenerative portion of the satellite is severely limited by foreseeable technology. for example, only about 100 mhz of the available 2.5 ghz bandwidth is feasible for baseband processing. however. most results of this study will apply to any traffic model. traffic model discussions are found in appendix a. these considerations provide a workable foundation for baseband processor designs. the system presented in this report is for illustrative purposes and does not necessarily suggest an optimum solution. technology improvements and/or subsequent optimum designs will provide greater capability for handling more demanding traffic model requirements at baseband. the satellite is organized so that users may send their low data rate traffic to the baseband processor which will demodulate, process, route and remodulate the users\\' messages. users requiring higher data rates will use the microwave switch on-board the satellite rather than the on-board baseband processor. the microwave switch accomplishes message routing by switching the undemodulated rf carriers from an uplink beam to a selected downlink beam. section 3 of this report deals with the baseband processor while section 4 covers the microwave switch. a more detailed description of each section follows. b 1 a-\\\\t -\", \"section 3 begins with a brief introduction and a definition of

switch, including its hardware implementation and a weight estimate, is found in section 4.5. section 4.6 contains conclusions about the microwave switch based on this research. this report contains several appendixes that provide a more detailed investigation of many satellite communications related a.,\\\\t topics. appendix a contais a traffic matrix based on a postulated customer premises terminal population. this appendix explains the matrix derivation anti provides suggestions of how the matrix might be used in conjunct.ion with the satellite communications system under study. 7 4 i\", \\'an efficient access scheme for non-real-time data is presented in appendix b. low duty factor terminals with non-real-time data can utilize satellite channels very efficiently without any centralized control. this appendix addresses the feasibility of this concept for small use- as an alternative to the use of the network protocols. two approaches to all-di gital demodulation schemes are considered in appendix c. the first approach investigated is the straightforward analog-to-digital (ajd) conversion of the uplink signals followed by the multiplication and accumulation of b-bit quantized samples. the second approach utilizes the cordic rotation. an introductory overview of surface acoustic wave devices (sawds) and charged coupled devices (ccds) is presented in appendix d. references are provided to the reader interested in further details. appendix e updates and expands on material that appeared in mitre\\\\\\'s first year reports to nasa [1, ?lconcerning bandwidth and power efficient modulations. 8 f\"a\\', \\'section 3 baseband processor in a narrow sense, a baseband processor is the subsystem of the satellite communication payload that manipulates bits (b) or sequencies of bits (packets) of information gleaned from the digital signals received on the uplinks. the inputs and outputs of this subsystem are binary data only. the input bits are derived from incoming intermediate frequency (if) bandwidth signals by the process of demodulation which converts individual signals to their relatively smaller information bandwidths (basebands) through detecting the bits of data imparted to the transmitted signals. the output bits are the basis for the remodulation process whereby uplink signals are regenerated for the satellite downlinks. according to this definition the baseband processor hardware is purely digital in nature. however, since many functions of packet buffering, reformatting, switching, etc., are performed, considerable software or firmware is also associated or included with the baseband processor. in this section, the baseband processor hardware aspects are covered by discussions of a multi- microprocessor architecture and candidate implementations using state-of-the-art or predicted electronic technologies. the software aspects are treated primarily in terms of packet protocols. in a wider sense, the baseband processor includes the demodulators and remodulatdrs, because they constitute the interfaces through which the on-board digital processor communicates with the outside world. the uplink interface is emphasized in this section since the demodulators potentially have the greatest impact on communications payload weight and power. bandwidth and power efficient digital modulations are also highlighted. a baseline system design resulting in a baseband throughput capacity of approximately 1.6 gb/s or 1.024 m, 1544 b packets per second(s) is postulated below. this provides a specific: context for more detailed subsystem design and analysis. 3.1 baseline system assumptions the essential ingredients of the advanced domestic satellite communication system are multiple beam antennas for frequency reuse, bandwidth efficient modulation and coding for spectral and power 9 e\\', \\'conservation, and on-board processing and switching for servicing many different traffic and user requi.ements. satellite weight and power constraints which might be associated with baseband processing are expected to be in the order of 400 kg and 2 kw. this would include the functions of uplink demodulation, baseband processing of data packets, remodulation, and downlink transmission power; antenna weight is not included. with this weight and power budget, one can expect to support in the order of 100 mhz of spectral bandwidth devoted to signals to be processed at baseband.[11 the remainder of the 2.5 ghz bandwidth allocation at 30/20 ghz would be used for signals which are to be rf switched and not regenerated on-board the satellite. the frequency bands should be reused many times by utilizing multiple beam antennas. a fundamental assumption for the perceived relative traffic flow among terminals and through this domestic communication satellite determines the average connectivities among users. the assumption is that communications traffic from area a to area b is directly proportional to the product of the numbers of customer premises terminals in region a and region b. this is contrary to the intuitive assumption pertaining to normal telephone traffic where completely localized conversations constitute a relatively fixed fraction of the total traffic of a region regardless of the population of that region. the traffic model adopted here is more expected for communications among private corporations, government agencies, universities, and other institutions employing rooftop terminals. a further simplifying assumption is that the distribution of customer premises terminals is directly proportional to human population. given a list of the more densely populated areas in the country and a corresponding distribution of customer premises terminals, a reasonable traffic matrix can be generated and used to estimate the baseband switching connections or slot allocations on- board the spacecraft. an example of such a traffic matrix produced by mitre using a terminal distribution postulated by trw [a] is shown in table 3-1. \\\\t(see also appendix a.) if the extreme entries in the traffic matrix are too different to reconcile with slot assignments alone, then perhaps the discrepancies can be partially recouped by power control which would permit different burst rates as well. for users requiring high link availability, e.g., 0.999 and above, site diversity is required to overcome rain attenuation. power control on the uplinks or downlinks might also be used to advantage. 10 i 4\\', \\'o h con a 0a ah h01 y a u un u ci 0 .fl a^ y it ir a+

provided certain communications services is assumed. when these new services become a reality via future 30/20 ghz band satellites, the users may be content with more modest link availabilities, e.g., 0.99 and below, because they are not accustomed to any particular link quality and access expectations. the economics of providing such service will not be focused on the present common carrier tariff structure; instead, the profit motive would focus more on the huge numbers of small terminals that could be sold in the satellite communications service catering to lower duty factor users. availability of affordable terminals for a new service would create a technology pull, as opposed to demand push. stimulation of technology-pull is appropriate for government action through a nasa development. further pursuit of such philosophical issues is beyond the scope of this report. 3.1.1 uplink and downlink s ystem interfaces in the baseline design, it is assumed that there are 16 independent uplink beams and 16 independent downlink beams associated with the baseband processor. each uplink beam uses the same 100 mhz bandwidth in the uplink frequency allocation, and similarly on the do .mink. assuming a spectrally efficient modulation scheme a..ch yields one b/s per hz, the baseband throughput of the satellite will be approximately 1.6 lb/s. for the sake of specific discussion, the 16 uplink or downlink beams are arbitrarily divided into eight fixed beams and eight scanning beams. a common 1 ms frame interval, subdivided into eight 125 microsecond slots, is assumed for both types of beam. the beam and slot organizations permit a combination of fdma and tdma operation. in a fixed beam, a number of fdma carriers, each employing tdma within a frame. may be used. in a scanning beam, a number of fdma signals operating in a single channel per carrier (scpc) mode are present in the beam during a given dwell interval. in this case, each carrier is associated with a different terminal user. at the end of each 125 microsecond slot, a scanning beam is free to move to another coverage area. the period of every scanning beam is one frame or eight slots. thus, nominally, a scanning beam would return to the same coverage area every eight slots, although the eight specific coverage areas visited could be reprogrammed from epoch to epoch. a fixed beam can be viewed as a special case of the scanning beam where the coverage area does not change. in order to maintain a given data rate f. a terminal located in a scanning beam coverage area must burst its data at a channel rate 12\\', \\'of or. similarly, in a fixed beam with a carrier utilizing tdma, a given terminal must burst at 8r. consequently, if tdma is not used on a fixed beam carrier, the burst rate is equal to r. the nominal user data rate in the baseline system i, 1.544 mb/s. this is equivalent in data late but not necessarily in signal structure to a t1 carrier. the baseline design will also incorporate t2 rate users at 6.312 mb/s and lower rate users typically in the order of 64 kb/s. a ti rate user in a scanning beam must burst at approximately 12.3 mb/s channel data rate during a scanning beam dwell. this, along with the one bit per cycle assumption implies that eight fdma carriers at the burst rate may be accommodated in the 100 mhz bandwidth of the scanning beam. note that in this sense, the one b/s per hz assumption applies to the center frequency spacing between carriers. this implies that 64 t1 class users may be serviced concurrently within a scanning beam. with eight scanning beams and eight fixed beams, each interpreted as a special case of the scanning beam, a total capacity equivalent to 1,024 t1 users is implied. 3.1.2 rationale for system parameter selection it is important to understand the fundamental reasons for a given frame period and for the need for scanning beams. although the particular values selected for the frame duration and the number of slots per frame are only nominal, some explanation of how they were selected follows. it is assumed that the satellite is in either a geostationary or a near-geostationary orbit. this implies a round-trip propagation delay of approximately a quarter of a second. for real- time traffic, it is desirable that any satellite processing delay not contribute significantly to the overall delay. one potential source of processing delay on-board the satellitk derives from the possible accumulation of several bursts of uplink data from one source terminal in an fdma mode to produce a single, higher rate burst of data to a single destination terminal in a tdm downlink mode. assuming that each uplink burst is received in the same slot of the periodic satellite frame, and that the downlink burst will occupy the same slot duration, the key parameters are tf, frame duration and the number of frames required to accumulate the downlink bur t data. in the most straightforward realization of the present approach, the ratio of the downlink burst rate to the uplink r\\\\tburst rate is equal to the number of slots in a frame. thus, if an 13\\', \\'uplink user has access to only one slot per frame and the satellite is accumulating data from that user for one particular downlink user, it takes a number of frames equal to the number of slots per frame to accumulate the entire downlink burs: data. the parameters of 1 ms per frame and eight slots per frame imply a typical processing delay of 8 ms. since this is much less than a one-way propagation delay, the integrity of real-time data will be preserved even though such on-board processing is performed. another form of on-board processing delay is that incurred by waiting for an appropriate downlink slot and/or beam for the destination of accumulated uplink data. this type of delay is typically upper bounded by the frame duration rather than some multiple of the frame period. accordingly, this constraint is less stringent than the one implied by the fdma/tdm conversion technique discussed above. for real-time data, the frame could be in the order of 10 ms long if it were determined just by the tolerable waiting time for downlink slots nr beams. this would be possible if every packet received during an uplink slot always was retransmitted in a downlink subslot of one-eighth a slot duration within the next frame. for non-real time data, much longer frames could be utilized. this could be advant^.geous for smaller, less expensive, low duty factor terminals which might employ ground-packet-radio type protocols with high channel efficiency. (see appendix b.) the number of slots in a frame was selected to be a power of two for convenience of binary representation in the baseband processor and in the order of ten to construct an illustrative system without too large a burst rate disparity between the uplilks and downlinks. the 1 ms frame is of the right order of magnitude to avoid excessive processing delay, and when subdivided into eight slots, a standard 125 micresecond slot duration compatible with t1 signal structures results. uniform slot durations have been assumed in the baseline design for simplicity and to provide a convenient means of determining and controlling required burst rates and scanning beam dwell distributions. although the resulting design would probably be more complex, it is certainly possible to envision non-uniform slot durations in conjunction with variable and programmable frame partitions. the rationale for scanning beams follows from the basic system design objective of complete coverage of the continental united states (conus) and the highly non-uniform population density in this country. a reasonable engineering judgment for the baseline design is that a collection of fixed beams only would be an inefficient realization of spacecraft hardware and platform space. an 14\\', \\'alternative recommendation is a combination of fixed beams and scanning beams where the scanning beams would be time-shared to cover the less densely populated and more remote regions of the country. the fixed beams would be designed for the metropolitan areas surrounding the major cities. each scanning beam would be preprogrammed to visit a given coverage area with a cumulative dwell time that is proportional to the population of that area. this schedule would normally be followed automatically on-board the spacecraft without any ground control. perturbations from the average scanning beam dwell distribution would be specified by central ground command on a relatively infrequent basis to reflect gradual shifts in traffic demand. (see appendix a.2.) 3.2 features of on-board processing the type of advanced domestic satellite envisioned for t1, t2 and lower data rate communications applications includes a regenerating repeater. this portion of the satellite demodulates uplink signals to baseband; processes the data bits by performing error control, baseband switching, and reformatting; and remodulates the data for the downlink. this contrasts with the rf switch portion of the satellite which does no demodulation or remodulation of t3 and t4 rate data but switches the signal channels among beams under a tdm scheme. 3.2.1 final regeneration the regeneration of data by the baseband processor has the advantage of improving performance or permitting smaller terminals and a lighter satellite to maintain a given margin. these reductions are due to lower power and smaller antennas and result in lower cost. conventional transponder satellites simply hard-limit, frequency translate, and amplify the incoming signals. this repeats uplink noise and introduces on-board intermodulation products due to satellite nonlinearities. these degradations imply the need for higher power, larger antennas, and low:- ,r noise receivers to ferret out the useful signals. on the uplink, the terminals can burst at much lower rates with fdma then with tdma. the burst rate and burst length difference factor equals the number of slots per frame. this difference can be significant in reducing terminal cost since it implies less effective isotropic radiated power (eirp) for the same energy per bit and a more relaxed timing requirement. 15\\', \"another issue is the degree to which terminals must be coordinated as members of a network with respect to transmission timing, frequency, and power. many existing bandwidth efficient modulation schemes do not require stringent network coordinatio3 in this case, the burden of demodulating simultaneous signals f: ,m independent terminals is placed on the satellite. although this increases satellite complexity, it can simplify the terminals, and this philosophy may be economically attractive in a system of many more terminals than satellites. sin . signals are regenerated by demodulation and remodulation on-boar the satellite, there is the opportunity for choosing a different downlink signal format than used on the uplink. in parti:ular, tdm downlinks which may operate at many times the uplink burs rates, e.g., eight times in the baseline design, are recommended. in the fdma mode of operation, several signals coming from separate earth terminals are simultaneously demodulated by the satellite. these data are switched, reformatted, and combined with data from other uplink beams into a set of tdm downlinks, one for each downlink beam. each tdm downlink data stream is broadcast from the common satellite platform and received by all active terminals in the coverage region of that downlink beam. destination terminals select portions of this tdm traffic addressed to them. this fdma/tdm multiple access/multiplexing scheme leads to lower cost terminals and minimizes intermodulation problems of the satellite. the fundamental reason for tdm rather than fdm downlink is the desire to avoid unnecessary intermodulation interference arising from generating too many downlink signals at distinct carrier frequencies with the simultaneous operation of nonlinear power amplifiers on-board the satellite. the higher downlink burst rate implied is more manageable in this case because all downlink signals emanate from the same platform, which may employ a common master timing reference. this makes the task of acquiring, tracking, and demodulating downlink bursts in the terminal much easier, compared to a situation where bursts from different terminals are generated from separate clocks (as on the uplink), 3.2.2 baseband switching a much more important advantage of on-board processing in the form of satellite regeneration of the signal may be the great i\\\\t increase in flexibility for switching and interconnecting users on a \\'\\\\t \\\\t bit or packet level basis. with the regenerating repeater, one is no longer restricted to a point-to-point network structure. one-to- many, many-to-one, and conferencing applications can be envisioned as well. by demodulating the lower rate data, opportunities for on- 16 l^3 0\", \"board storage with buffers or bulk memory are introduced. this can be advantageous for collecting data to a destination not yet in a scanning beam coverage area, for example. it can also be useful for error control, link protocols, and reformatting data for the downlink, as noted. tile baseband switching topic is the heart of this section and is discussed at greater length in sections 3.4 through 3.8. 3.3 demodulation/remodulation major contributions to spacecraft weight and power, resulting from the baseband processor and its communications related interfaces, are implied by on-board demodulation, especially if an all digital implementation is selected for the demodulators. several alternatives for accomplishing the demodulation of upli-iks, all digital, hybrid analog/digital, and all analog, are indicated in the general block diagram of figure 3-1. each of these alternatives is discussed in some detail in all\\\\tto ascertain the most suitable approach.

with the same relative received power level could be allocated to the same sub-band according to either on-board processing or ground control protocols. this would result in either lower crosstalk, or permit the closer packing of the fdma signals in the sub-band for a given crosstalk level. a closer packing of carriers would imply a narrower sub-band and the possibility of a lower a/d conversion sampling rate and less power consumption. 3.3.2 hybrid realizations the hybrid method of demodulation may involve an analog/digital demodulation technique utilizing surface acoustic wave devices (sawds) and/or charged coupled devices (ccds). with either family of devices, the basic signal processing and output detection involves analog quantities. (see appendix d.) the relative advantages and disadvantages of sawds and ccds are listed in table 3-2. this qualitative characterization should not be taken too literally because there is a large region of overlap in the bandwidth/time-delay space where either sawds or ccds can be applied. (see figure 3-2.) also, not all of the devices in either family possess every property shown in the table. it is recommended that sawds and ccds be examined as serious candidates for implementing spacecraft demodulators. their main advantage is in the potential for low volume and power consumption. although much has already been done in attempting to apply these analog devices to digital demodulation, additional development is warranted and on-going. sawds and ccds, may represent a higher risk for spacecraft implementation than the all-digital approach for lower rate signals. however, the higher data rates of this application may make sawds and ccds quite attractive for spacecraft implementation. the space qualification of these signal processing devices should have high priority. 3.3.3 microwave demodulatio the final alternative is a purely analog demodulation utilizing standard microwave circuitry.[b] this approach has the outstanding advantage of being very low power because the devices themselves are passive. for standard digital modulation schemes like quadriphase shift keying (qpsk) and offset or staggered qpsk (sqpsk), these devices are conceptually very simple and presumably can be packaged into small volumes. on the other hand, this microwave approach may not lead to the same high density level of vlsi circuitry achievable 19\\', \\'table 3-2 qualitative comparison of sawn and ccds surface acoustic wave devices wideband (good for spread spectrum and combatting multiple access interference) operate at if or rf (mixers not required at vhf/uhf) passive but high insertion loss (non-volatile but amplifiers required) radiation insensitive (good for operation in near-earth space) may be temperature unstable (oven may be required) frequency may be imprecise (tuning may be required)charged coupled devices narrowband (can handle low data rates easily) operate at baseband (mixers usually required) active but no insertion loss (volatile and power required) vulnerable to radiation (requires shielding in space) temperature stable (good for space operation) frequency stable (clocked operation) power, size, cost can be comparable ccds may have longer mean time before failure (mtbf) 20 1♦\\', \\'106 io6 107 106 in\\\\t 105 bandwidth th:)\\\\t 1b4 103 102 101 100twn104 sawds twi103 tine-bandwidth product \\\\t \\\\\\' tw i cods 10-8 10\"1 10 -7\\\\t10 -6 10 -5 10-4 10-3 10-2 10 -1\\\\t100 processing time (sec) t figure 3-2. approximate operating ranges of ccds and sawds 21 3\\', \\'with the all-digital approach or with sawds and ccds. more importantly, the microwave circuits cannot be used with more advanced bandwidth efficient modulation schemes where the bassband modulation shape is not rectangular, as it is with qpsk. if there is a way of demodulating more sophisticated waveforms in a completely passive and analog fashion using microwave circuits, there does not seem to be any available literature on such techniques. 3.3.4 imvlementation considerations some of the more advanced modulation schemes include minimum shift keying (msk), tamed frequency modulation (tfm), and various modulation schemes involving higher order alphabets, partial response signaling, and coding performance gains without bandwidth expansion. (see appendix e.) these newer modulation schemes offer worthwhile improvements in both power and bandwidth efficiency which can be translated directly into a greater number of users being served and/or smaller weight and power on-board the spacecraft. since the most advanced modulations involve slowly varying phase transitions, and because this is so new, further development of signal acquisition, tracking and synchronization techniques is required.[7) performance improvements with these modulations are obtained with greater complexity of signaling and demodulation. however, if the processing is done in a digital or hybrid fashion, as outlined above, increased performance may be worth the added complexity because of the continually improving higher density and lower power circuitry offered by vlsi technology. there are further important tradeoffs to be made between standard modulation techniques with established implementations and more advanced modulation techniques which require greater complexity and challenge the ingenuity of circuit designers. further investigations focused on these tradeoffs are strongly recommended. only rough estimates of the power consumption for the all-digital approach are attempted in this report. 22 3 0\\', \\'3.4 network protocols in order to design the baseband processor, several system requirements and goals must be defined. a major system requirement is the design of a network-wide protocol. this protocol must provide the users with a standard format in which to exchange messages, to maintain timing synchronization, to establish and terminate circuit connections, and to recover from message losses. the network protocol under investigation in this report is organized as a two-level protocol. each level is supported by a protocol which is custom tailored to meet the needs of the on-board processing satellite communications system. the protocol on the first level provides a demand-assignment multiple-access (dama) reservation scheme. the second level protocol controls the transmission of messages between the terminals. this two-level structure allows each protocol to operate independently. the protocol independence achieved by this two-level scheme offers the network considerable flexibility. updating or replacing an existing protocol on one level does not necessarily require an adjustment on the other level. as a matter of fact, it is possible to offer more than one level-two protocol to the users simultaneously. users can then select the protocol best suited for their needs on a message by message basis. in addition, choosing one of the implementation options for one level does not reduce the number of options available for the other level. for example, the first level protocol, which is called the link establishment protocol (lep), may be implemented either on-board the satellite or in a terrestrial control center. selecting one implementation over the other has no impict on which second-level protocol may be used between the terminals. in the same manner, choosing one of the many available second level protocols, which are known as packet routing protocols (prps) will not limit the selection of level-one protocols. the prps may be organized as end-to-end protocols that are transparent to the satellite switching processing or as uplink protocols requiring on-board processor capabilities. forward-error- correction (fec) or automatic-repeat-request (arq) functions can also be supported by the prps. a look at the various prps available for satellite systems is presented later in this section. a review of the lep is presented next. 3.4.1 link establishment protocol the primary function of the lep is straightforward: the lep mist provide every user with the ability to request and to receive a channel assignment. in order to support this service, the protocol 23\\', \"must provide a standard procedure in which channel requests, assignments, and denials can be made in a format usable by all terminals. since the network connects terminals that use different data rates, message types, and special services, the protocol must be flexible in design and general in operation. the orderwire scheme considered in this work allows a user to request a channel for the duration of his message. in addition, the user specifies the message type, its length, priority and destination(s). he may also request special functions (e.g., broadcasting, conferencing, etc.) and/or special data rates. this flexibility allows every user to custom order a channel suited to his needs. the lep can be implemented either on-board the satellite or in a ground station control center. the following depicts the flow of control packets as a user attempts to reserve a channel when the orderwire processor is located on the ground. the source first sends a link request packet to the control center via the satellite. when the request arrives at the center it is processed. first, the network\\'s ability to supply a channel is checked. if the network cannot provide a free channel, the source is sent a link status packet via the satellite informing him of the busy channels. if the network has an available link, the center sends a query packet to the desired sink via the satellite. this packet informs the sink of the pending channel request and inquires into the sink\\'s availability. the sink answers the query by sending a response packet to the center via the satellite. upon receiving the response, the center generates and sends a link status packet to the source. if the sink is free, the center sets up the circuit while the link status packet is on its way to the source. if the sink is busy, the link status packet informs the source, who may want to request the channel again at some later time. the scheme requires a double satellite hop in each direction which will result in link establishment times of no less than one second. when the controller is located on-board the satellite, the operation of the lep itself is identical to that described above. the difference is that this particular implementation requires only a single satellite hop in each direction. this permits a minimum link establishment time of half a second. in addition to better response time, the probability of an error occurring during transmission is reduced since each packet travels over one satellite link rather than two. these benefits of on-board processing require increased satellite weight, size, and power consumption since additional memory, processors and control logic will be required to implement the lep. 24 .3 e\", \\'although the function of this reservation scheme is to provide the users with a means of requesting contention-free message channels, the orderwire channel itself is not constrained to any particular accessing scheme. as a matter of fact, there are several accessing schemes which are suitable for use on the orderwire channel. the more popular schemes are pure aloha, slotted aloha and tdm.18, 91 the selection of one accessing scheme over another for the orderwire depends greatly on the characte-istics of the network. use of the pure aloha accessing scheme for the orderwire is recommended for networks that do not require frequent channel assignments. one such network would consist of a large number of terminals that transmit short, bursty messages on an infrequent basis. another network suitable for the aloha scheme is one with a large number of terminals that only need access to the orderwire processor after long periods of time because they are constantly busy transmitting long messages. slotted aloha could be used in similar networks to improve efficiency at the cost of additional complexity. in order for tdm to be efficient, the terminals must make use of their assigned slots as often as possible. the reservation scheme proposed for this satellite communications system may not serve all users efficiently. low duty terminals that transmit only a few packets at one time will incur a large amount of lep overhead while reserving a message channel. these terminals should be provided an alternative accessing scheme. one possible alternative is to provide these users with a contention channel. users could compete for this channel by directly transmitting their message packets. a pure aloha or slotted aloha scheme could be implemented on this channel. the operation of the lep begins when a user determines that he has a message to transmit. the flow of control packets due to a request for a point-to-point circuit is shown in figure 3-3. a user (the source), generates a link request packet. \"many different types of lep control packets exist. however, they are all organized within the same format to make processing easier. see section 3.5 for more information. the link request is then sent to the orderwire processor (the controller). this control packet notifies the controller that a user is requesting a circuit to a specific sink in the network. the link request packet contains the address of both the source and the sink, as well as the length, type and priority of the message to be transmitted. in addition, the packet contains fields in which the source can specify special services such as non-standard data rates. 2\"\\', \\'inal terminate call o\\\\tthe source iterminal i) transmits a link request to the controller rewisting a link to the sink (terminal i). ®\\\\tthe controller sends a query to the sink after receiving the link request. cd\\\\tsink replies to the ouf.rv by sending the controller a response. q\\\\tif the sink is ready to receive the message from the source, the controller establishes a circuit between the source and the sink. the controller then sends the source link status indicating the circuit has been established. if the sink is not ready, the controller simply sends the source link status indicating that no circuit can of provided at this time. ®\\\\tif the source receives link status packet indicating that the circuit to the sink is ready, the source transmits the message. ® once the transmission of the message is completed. the source sends the controller a terminate call packet. the controller then disengages the circuit. time out clock is started for the packet. figure 3-3. the link establishment protocol (point-to-point) 26118--1 f r f\\', \"after thi source transmits the request, he stores p copy of it in memory and starts a time-out clock. should *he request go unanswered beyond a pre-set time for any reason, the time -out clock will expire and alert the source to the problem. whenever a time- out occurs the source increments the time-out counter associated with the lost packet. if the counter\\'s value has not exceeded a specified number of tolerable failures, the packet is retransmitted and the time-clock is restarted. if the value of this counter exceeds a system specified value, the source enters a trouble- shooting routine to determine the cause of the multiple transmission failures. after receiving a control packet the first task the controller undertakes is lhe detection of errors. if the packet contains errors, the controller destroys the corrupted packet and moves on to a new task. since packets are protected by time-out clocks, their destruction will result in either a retransmission or a maintenance check. when a control packet survives the error check, the controller determines whit type of control packet has arrived. if the control packet is found to be a link request, the controller checks to see what type of transmission mode has been requested. the network provides three modes for both data and voice messages. the standard mode is point-to-point which provides either a one-way or a bidirectional channel between one source and one sink. the broadcasting mode option provides the source with a one- way channel to as many as 16 sinks. the third option is conferencing. this mode provides a duplex channel between a source and as many as 16 sinks. with the address of the source and the sink(s), and the requested mode now known, the controller determines whether the channel hardware is available. if the system cannot provide the necessary hardware for the requested link. the source is notified via a link status packet which is sent to him by the controller. if the system can supply the link, the next task to be carried out by the controller is the determination of sink availability. this is accomplished by sending the sink(s) a query packet. these packets inform the sink of pending link requests and also inquire into the sink\\'s availability. a query packet is sent after the centroller stores a copy of the link request packet that initiated the query packet, and the query packet\\'s time-out clock is started. at the sink. tht_ received control packet is checked for errors. if errors are detected, the control packet is destroyed. error-free control packets receive further processing. after the query packet is processed, the sink generates a response packet based on the sink\\'s current status. the response is then sent to the controller. 27\", \\'upon rrrival at the controller, the response packet is checked for arrors. if the packet contains errors it is destroyed. this will cause the time-out clock associated with the original query packet to expire. the expired clock results in the retransmission of the query packet, which should result in thu retransmission of the response packet. if, however, the response packet was received error-free the controller clears the associated time-out clock. the controller then checks to see what type of connection the source and sink need. if the requested link is for point-to-point communications, the controller checks the response packet to determine whether the sink is available. if the responding sink is free, the controller generates and sends a link status packet to the source telling him the circuit is to be established. while the link status packet is on its way to the source the controller establishes the link. whenever the requk*sted sink for a point-to-point transmission is busy, the controller sends a link status packet informing the source of the situation. no link is established. the source must request the link again at a later time if he still requires the channel. if the requested transmission mode is multipoint (broadcasting and conferencing), the controller cannot send a link status packet until all the sinks queried reply. as each sink replies the corresponding link status packet is updated. once the final response packet is rectsi-nd, the controller checks the link status packet that has been generated. if the status is that all the requested sinks are available, the controller establishes the links and sends the link status packet to the source. the source will begin transmission once the link status packet is received and correctly d^coded. the flow of control packets when a multipoint transmission mode is requested is displayed in figure 3-4. if the controller discovers that not all the sinks are available, it must take a different course of action. this course of action is depicted in figure 3-5. the controller sends the link status packet to the source and it starts a time.-out for this packet. the time-out is necessary since, unlike other link status ipackets, this one requires a reply from the source terminal in the form of a link acceptance packet. the link acceptance packet is used to inform the controller whether or not the source wants the \"partial link\" to the available sinks. thus, if the message can be sent to the unavailable sink(s) later, (e.g., one branch office sending electronic mail to the other offices), the source may decide f\\\\t to transmit to the available sink(s) first. if the sink(s) missing from the multipoint link is important, (e.g.. teleconferencing where each )-oard member called is required to discuss and vote on a business deal,) the source may not want to transmit to only those 23i\\',

established a link to his sink(s) via the lep, he begins the transmission of his message. the exchange of messages between the terminals in controlled b y the prp. since the network supports different users, data rates, message types and transmission modes, more than one prp is needed to control the traffic. the proposed scheme requires the source to select the best suited protocol available from the network for each message he sends. \\\\tthe source must specify the protocol chosen whets requesting the link so that the sink(s) can be notified. thus, once the actual message transmission starts ,both the source and the sink(s) are synchronized to operate under the same protocol. since the network may support many protocols, some users may not need to use every protocol. thus, users could purchase only the software packages that they need (v.g., a user- who will only transmit and receive voice messages would only need those prps which support voice communications). this scheme should be beneficial to the network as well as to the users. \\\\tif the network is to be successful, a large number of users are needed to support it with their tariffs. \\\\tin order- to :attract this large number of users, the network must provide services for all types of users. potential customers who may want to join the network but lacked the initial capital needed to buy all the available software, could be enticed into the network with a starter package: possibly a copy of the 1.ep software and one or two prps. once in the network, they may expand their services and provide the network with aciditiontal tariffs. larger customers could also be , attracted to the network by its flexibility and by the large number of available software packages. the key to selling the network will he flexibility: \\\\tflexibility in .available services and in tariff rates. this report investigates five packet routing protocols. the operation, features, disadvantages, advantages, and requirements of each protocol are presented. \\\\\\'phis survey is by no means exhaustive, 31 !i0\\', \"but it does provide an insight into the benefits and problems of a multi-protocol network (mpn). • prp-1 prp-1 provides the network with an uplink arq scheme in addition to an end-to-end arq scheme. this protocol operates on a packet-by-packet basis. figure 3-6a shows the normal flow of packets under the control of prp-1. figures 3-6b and 3-6c show the flow of packets under the control of prp-1 during error conditions. operation of prp-1 begins with the source first sending a message packet to the satellite. the source then stores a copy of this packet and starts a time-out clock. onboard the satellite, the received packet is processed by the switch. the packet header., which is protected by an error-correcting code, is corrected if necessary. meanwhile, the packet body, which is encoded with an error-detection code, is checked for errors. if the packet contains errors, the source is sent a negative-acknowledgment (nack) packet and the message packet is destroyed. the source must retransmit the message packet after receiving the nack. if the packet arrives at the routed and sent to the proper sink correction and detection routines errors are detected in the packet packet and transmit a nack to the only if it is error-free. in this the successful packet transmission packet sent by the sink.satellite without errors, it is . at the sink, the error- are repeated on the packet. if any body, the sink will disregard the source. the packet is accepted event, the source is informed of via an acknowledgment (ack) as mentioned above, the source starts a time-out clock each time it sends a packet. the clock is reset every time an ack or nack is received. however, if the clock expires before the source receives either an ack or nack, the source assumes either that the packet was lost or the ack/nack reply was lost. the source can either retransmit the message packet or (if the transmission failure rate has exceeded a system regulated level) enter a maintenance mode. the flow of packets in the event of a time-out is shown in figure 3-6d. prp-1 can be utilized for the transmission of short error- sensitive, non-real-time messages. this protocol may not be practical for long and/or real-time messages. the limitations of this protocol result from the long delays between sending a packet and receiving an ack/nack message. due to the two round-trip propagation delays to and from the satellite, this delay is a minimum of 1;2 of a second. this does not include

presented to illustrate why this particular protocol is not best suited for long messages. assume a user has a message which consists of 10,000 packets; assume further that due to the current system loading, the delay time between transmitting a packet and receiving an ack/nack message is 3/4 of a second. using prp-1, the entire message transmission will require a total of 125 minutes to complete. additional time will be required for every nack received by the source since a retransmission is required. in addition to this long transmission time, the source is forced to store the large message for a long time. the source can only free one memory location every 3/4 of a second, provided an ack was received for the packet residing in that location. the major advantages of using prp-1 are: 1.an uplink arq function is provided which reduces the consumption of downlink bandwidth by corrupted packets. 2.end-to-end arq is provided, ensuring the retransmission of packets received in error. 3.time-out hardware and/or software is required only at the terminals. during transmission only the source is required to activate the time-out system. the primary costs and disadvantages of using prp-1 are: 1.prp-1 cannot be used efficiently for long messages. 2.since packets may not arrive at the sink in real-time (-i second), prp-1 should be used only for non-real-time messages. 3.an error-correction capability is required at both the terminals and the satellite. error-correction is a non- trivial problem for even modest size messages. however, since the protocol is based on the principle of ack/nack generation for each packet, it is essential that the packet headers be error-free. if the packet headers are not error-free, packets could be routed incorrectly, ack \\'nack messages could be sent for the wrong packet and\\\\tnot sent to the right source, and the retrans- mission of the wrong; packets could also occur. the ack/nack packets themselves should be encoded with an error-correction code. 35\", \\'4.an error-detection capability at both the terminals and the satellite is required. in order for any arq scheme to operate, detection of errors is essential. error correction does not pose as great a problem as error detection does. however, it still requires a careful investigation of the various schemes and system trade- offs. 5.as seen in figure 3-7, it is possible for the sink to receive duplicate copies of a valid packet. therefore, the sink must have the ability to sort the incoming packets. 6.smaller size ack/nack packets are needed since it is impractical to send full-size message packets for a single ack/nack. in order to use this smaller packet, additional hardware and/or software is needed at both the terminals and on-board the satellite. 7.all unacknowledged packets must be buffered by the source. • prp-2 the operation of prp-2 is shown in figure 3-8. prp-2 is similar to prp-1 with one exception; no uplink arq service is provided by prp-2. the service that is provided, consists of an end-to-end arq scheme on a packet-by-packet basis. this protocol is virtually transparent to the switch since no protocol-related data processing is required of the switch. like prp-1, prp-2 is best used for short, error-sensitive, non-real-time data messages. the advantages of prp-2 are: 1.end-to-end arcs service is provided for each packet. 2.time-out hardware and/or software is required only at the terminals. during a transmission only the source is required to use the time-out facilities. 3.error-correction processing is not required on-board the satellite, although correction could be used to decrease routing mistakes due to packet header errors. the costs and disadvantages of prp-2 are: 1.\\\\tprp-2 cannot be used

receive duplicate copies of valid packets. 5.special size ack/nack packets are needed. 6.downlink bandwidth is now being used to transmit packets that ..ontain errors as well as the valid packets. thus, some of the potential processing power on-board the satellite is untapped. 7.the source must buffer all packets that are unacknowleged. a prp-3 the flow of packets under control of prp-3 is shown in figure 3-9. the protocol allows users to handle their messages as strings of packets. when the source begins transmission to the sink, the source sends a fixed-length string of packets. the length of this string is selected during the link establishment procedure and it remains constant for the duration of the session. when the string of packets hab been sent, the source starts a time-out clock and waits for an ack/nack message from the sink. at the sink, the system receives and stores each incoming packet. error correction is carried out on the header while error- detection is carried out on the packet body. the error status of each packet is included in a single ack/nack message for the whole string. when the final packet in the string arrives, the ack/nack message is sent to the source. if the ack/nack message contains only acks, the source sends a new string of packets. otherwise the source retransmits the packets identified by the hacks. these packets are retransmitted in the next string, displacing some of the new packets that were slated for that string. if a message does not contain enough packets to fill an integer number of strings, the last string is shortened to the required length. in the case of a time-out, the source is required to retransmit the entire string that has gone unacknowledged. prp-3 provides the user with an end-to-end arq scheme where the source receives ack/nack responses for each packet sent in fixed-length strings. 39 1,f\\', \\'terminal \\\\t mmp1, mp2.... mpn ^ack ,mpiimmpz, \\\\t... ^n ® myn+1, pn+ \\\\tmp2n

do not send and receive all classes of message, they 45 ^r\\', \\'may not want to support all the available prps in order to reduce the cost of their terminal or tariff. 3.4.3 protocol time-out parameters most of the protocols introduced in the previous sections rely on time-out clocks to notify the source of a message that the message has gone unacknowledged too long. in order to design the various time-out clocks, the amount of time they are to run before timing-out needs to be determined. before these times can be calculated, the following parameters must be defined: 1.t = propagation time to the satellite \\\\t(uplink) 2.td= propagation time from the satellite (downlink) 3.trt= t \\\\t+ td = round -trip satellite propagation delay 4.t= processing time at the controller (orderwire p^processor) s.t= processing time at the sink (receiver)pr 6.t= processing time at the source (transmitter)pt i.t,[-)s= processing time at the switch for a message packet or an ack/hack message packet s.11. psi= processing time at the switch for the single ack/1ack packet \\\\t(prp-1 and prp-2) 9.\\\\tsmi\\\\t= safety margin i an important point about the parameter definitions is that the processing times at each node include the demodulation times. the delays due to demodulation may vary depending on the packet lengths and the data rates. 3.4.3.1 the lep time-out values the time-out values calculated in this section are based on the assumption that the controller is located on-board the satellite. if the controller were located in an earth station, these values would be larger as a result of extra propagation delays and additional processing times due to signal regeneration. 46\\', \"the lep for point-to-point links requires two time-out clocks. one clock is needed for each query packet sent by the controller and the other time-out clock is used for each link request packet sent. since the value of the link request time-out clock is a function of the query packet time-out, the value of the query time-out is determined first. the cycle of a query packet includes its transmission to the sink, processing at the sink, the transmission of a response packet back to the satellite, and the processing of the packet by the controller. thus, time-out for a query packet = qto>td+tpr+tu+tpc+ sml\\\\t(3.1) the cycle of a link request packet includes the packet\\'s transmission time to the controller, processing at the controller, waiting for the query/response cycle, the transmission of a link status pa%;ket back to the source, and the processing at the source. thus, time-out for a link request packet = lrto > tu + tp` + nqto + tpt+ td + sm 2\\\\t (3.2) where n = the number of allowed query packet time-outs. the link lep for multipoint links (broadcasting, conferencing) requires two time-out clocks. the clocks are needed for the special link status packet for partial multipoint links and for the multipoint link request packet. the cycle of the special link status packet includes the packet transmission to the source terminal from the controller, the processing time at the source, and the transmission time of the link acceptance packet from the source to the controller. thus, time-out for a link status packet for partial multipoint = lsto>td+t  pt + t u \\\\t p+t c+sm3\\\\t(3.3) the cycle of the link request packet includes the transmission time of the packet from the source to the controller, the processing 47 0\", \\'r\\\\t __ time at the controller, the query/response cycle, and it may include the link status/link acceptance cycle. thus, time-out for a multipoint link request packet = lrto > tu + tpc + nq to+ m ls to + td + tpt + sm,}\\\\t(3.4) where n = the number of allowed query packet time-outs and m = the number of link status time-outs. 3.4.3.2 the prp time-out values the packet routing protocols require a time-out clock at the source of the message packets. this ensures that every source will receive either an ack/nack message or a time-out signal for each packet or packet string it sends. the prp-1 transmission cycle, which starts with the transmission of the message packet and ends with the source receiving an acknowledgment, entails quite a few stages. the message packet is first sent to the satellite, where it is processed and sent to the sink. at the sink, the packet is received and processed. the sink generates an acknowledgment message and sends it to the satellite. if the ack/nack message is error-free, it is then sent to the source terminal. however, if the ack/nack message contains errors, it is destroyed and the switch sends the sink a nack. the sink is then required to retransmit the acknowledgment packet. therefore, time-out for a message packet under prp-1 control = t\\\\t> t+ t + t + t + t + tprp-1\\\\tu\\\\tps\\\\td\\\\tpr\\\\tu\\\\tpsl + r(td + t + tu + tpsl) + d + t pr + sm5\\\\t(3.5) pr where r = the number of allowed uplink nacks for a given ack/nack message. equation (3.5) reduces to the following: tprp-1 ? 2t  + ps + 2t  + pr + tps 1 + r(td + tpr + u + tpsl) + tot + sm s\\\\t (3.5a) 48 11 3 0\\', \\'since t  + t d = trt, equation (3.5) can be further simplified, tprp-1 > 2trt + t + t + t \\\\t+ ps\\\\tpr\\\\tpal r(trt + tpr + tpsl) + t p t + sm5\\\\t(3.5b) since prp-2 is prp-1 without the uplink arq function, the time- out value is: tprp-2 > 2trt + tps + tpr + tp51 + tpt + sm 6\\\\t (3.6) prp-3 operates much like prp-2. the primary difference is that the ack/nack packets used in prp-3 are the same size as the message packets. therefore, all processing times at the switch are the same (t ). an additional difference in the two protocols is that packets are sent and acknowledged in strings in prp -3. however, since the time-out clock is not started until the last packet of a string has been sent, the equation used to determine the clock times is similar. thus, the time-out clock value for the prp-3 is: tprp-3 > 2trt + 2tps + tpr + tpt + sm 7\\\\t (3.7) since prp-4 is used to support voice messages, retransmissions due to time-outs are not required. therefore, no time-out mechanism is needed for this protocol. prp-5 operates much like prp-3. therefore, the time-out dock value for this protocol is: tprp-5 > 2trt + 2tp-s + t p i\\\\t p+ t t + sm 8\\\\t (3.8) these equations can be used to determine the impa%;t of packet delay times due to retransmissions. since the net,;ork is based on a geostationary satellite, t 11 z td z 1/8 second. 3.5 packet formats in order to support the two-level network protocol, two packet formats are needed. one type of packet is called the control 49 v.\\', \\'packet. these packets are used by the lep to establish and to disengage circuits between terminals. there are many kinds of control packets. however, every control packet shares an identical format. this helps to keep the processing costs to a minimum by standardizing the system hardware and software. the second type of packet is the message packet. every message packet consists of a header, which contains the routing control signals and message reconstruction information, and a body. the body contains the actual message being sent. 3.5.1 control packet format all control packets, regardless of their function, share the same packet format. this helps to simplify processing requirements as well as hardware. needs. each control packet consists of four field categories. the various control fields within the control packet are displayed in figure 3-12. the first category of fields is the control data category. the first field in this category is the packet type field. this field identifies the type of control packet being used. the eight control packets associated with the lep and their functions are: 1.link request - the link request packets are used by terminals that need satellite links to other terminals. the source terminal must send the link request to the controller to initiate the link establishment. the packet contains information regarding the message, the type of link desired, the source, the sink, the required routing protocol and the tariff charges. this packet is issued onl y by terminals which are to be the source of a call. 2.query - the controller sends quer y packets to all terminals that have been specified is sinks in a link request. each query packet contains the same information found in the link request that initiated the link establishment procedure. titus, the sink is informed of the sources request and :311 the details concerning the pending message. in addition, upon receiving a query packet, a sink is obligated to inform the controller as to whether or not he is available to receive the message from the source. query packets can be issued only by the controller. 50\\', \"44 ^ w q w o w r r ^n w dg^ y c w 4l a rwnr en n7l _2\\\\t¢ w\\\\tm w z o 171w • z w (\\'iw n d w f q q0 ¢m ~ rw wy lyyr s j r ^, o nw\\\\tvr or n dp0m • w • ¢qn t7 rq ms iii

or not he is available to receive the source\\'s message. this packet also contains the message and link parameter information provided by the link request. response packets are generated by terminals that have been requested to be a message sink. 4.link status - once the controller receives a response packet from the queried sink, it sends the source a link status packet. again, this packet contains a copy of all the message and link requirements specified in the original link request packet. the link status packet relays the sink\\'s reply to the source. if the sink is busy, no link is provided. however, if the response packet indicates that the sink is available, the controller will establish the link and the source is free to transmit when he receives the link status packet. the source is not required to reply to a link status packet unless the link status indicates that the network is providing him with a partial multipoint link. when a response to a link status packet is needed, a special control packet is used. this packet is described next. only the controller can send link status packets. 5.link acceptance - the link acceptance packet is sent to the controller by a source who received a link status packet r.garding a partial multipoint link. the link acceptance packet informs the controller as to whether or not the source wants the partial multipoint link. this packet is generated by terminals that are the source of a message. 6.terminate call - when the source completes his message transmission, he sends a terminate call packet to the controller signalling the end of the call. the source terminal is the only node allowed to send this type of packet. 7.interrupt - if network problems or special conditions arise that require the network to reclaim an allocated link, the controller sends the users an interrupt packet. this packet informs the users that they have been pre- empted and must stop transmission immediately. the source must send the controller a terminate call packet to indicate he has acknowledged the interrupt. the controller will send the users a link status packet as 52\", \"soon as the network can re-establish a link. once the users receive the link status packet, they may resume transmission. the network permits only the controller is issue this control packet. 8.\\\\thello - the hello packets are used by the controller for testing and monitoring the status of the network. the controller can send a hello packet to any user in the network at anytime. when a user receives a hello packet he must send a hello packet back to the controller as soon as possible. using hello packets, the controller can determine delay times, user availability, channel quality, and the location of link/node failures. the next field in the control data category is the status/clock field. this field allows the users and the controller to send either status information or clock synchronization data to one another. the first bit in the field identifies the next 32 bits as either status or clock data. when this field is used in a hello packet, it contains clock data so that the controller can measure delay times. following this field is the sink status field. this field is organized as 16 two-bit words. the need for the 16 status words stems from the fact that in multipoint communications, a source may request up to 16 sinks. when a sink replies to a query packet he must update the sink status word which corresponds to the position of his address in the sink address field (this field is explained later). for example, if a sink\\'s address is the third address in the sink address field, he must update the third status word in the sink status field. each word can assume one of four states. state i is found in all link request and query packets. states 2 through 4 are updated by the queried sinks and are found in all response and link status packets. states 3 and 4 are found in all hello packets sent to the controller by a user. when a user replies to a hello packet sent by the controller, no message follows. the hello packet is used only for status monitoring. this packet does not initiate a link establishment. the four :mates and their definitions are: 1.\\\\tno response- this ineicates that the sink has not responded to the query yet. this state should only be found in link request and query packets since it is an initial state. ?.\\\\tunacceptable conditions - this message is used to inform the source and the controller that the sink may be willing to accept the message if certain transmission parameters are changed. when the sink issues this control signal, he 53\", \\'must indicate the parameters he wants changed. he does this by replacing the current parameters with the ones he would like to operate under. if the source is able to meet the new requirements, he sends the controller a new link request packet (which now specifies the new conditions requested by the sink) and the link establishment procedure begins again. otherwise, the link is not established and the source must decide what to do about its incompatibility with the desired sink. 3.sink busy - when the sink is busy with another call or if he is unable to receive a message due to other reasons, he selects this message to semi in a response packet or hello packet. 4.sink ready - a sink generates this message when he is available and ready to receive the pending message. a user also sends this message in the hello racket if he is currently available to receive a message if one d.-,d exist. 3.5.1.2 message parameter_ fields the next group of fields found in the control packet is message parameters. the fields in this category allow the users to specify a message and how it is to be sent. this information is vital to the controller as well as the sink. the controller uses the information to establish the link while the sink requires the information to prepare for pending transmission. the first field in this category is message priority. this allows the users to assign one of four priorities to their messages. the higher the level of priority a message has, the lower the delay times the packets of that message experience. these options are offered to the users at various tariffs. the four levels of priority are: 1.no priority (standard tariff) 2.low priority 3.priority 4.high priority the second field is the missage mode. users can select one of three modes that use either a simplex, half-duplex or a duplex circuit. a simplex circuit provides one-way transmission while the duplex circuit provides simultaneous two-way communications. the half-duplex circuit provides two-way communications by providing 54\\', \\'message transmission in one direction at a time. the three message modes used in conjunction with the selectable circuits are: 1.point-to-point - this message mode connects a single source to a single sink. the role of source and sink may interchange during a call if a duplex or half-duplex circuit is used. 2.broadcasting - broadcasting allows a user to send a message to as many as 16 sinks. this mode does not require duplex circuits since it is considered as a \"one- to-many transmission\". (the sinks may send the source ack/nack messages if they are required by the packet routing protocol being used.) 3.conferencing - duplex circuits are required in this mode since any one of the up to 16 sinks may send a message as well as the original source. (half-duplex circuits may also be used, but this may require additional hardware/software complexity.) in this mode, every connected user has the ability to transmit a message and to receive all the messages sent by the other users during the duration of the call. message type is the third field found in the message parameters category. a user can specify one of 32 message types. the more well known message types are voice, data, video, and facsimile. each of these message types can be specified in more detail by the user. the user can do so by selecting one of the message prefixes provided in this field such as real-time, non-real-time, store-and- forward, and batch. in addition, various tariff rates could be selected as well. thirty-two options should provide ample flexibility for the users to vividly specify any message they will ever need to send. next to the message type field is the message length field. ini. field allows the source to specify any message length up to 1.49 x 10 bits. the message length is encoded using two blocks within the field that total 24 bits. the first block is 4 bits wide and is used to encode the units of the message. a user can select one of 11 message units. the units available are: 1.bits 2.nibbles (4 bits) 3.byte (8 bits) 55\\', \\'ff\\\\\\'. - 4.words (16 bits) 5.double words (32 bits) 6.64 bits 7.128 bits 8. 256 bits 9.512 bits 10. 1024 bits 11.1424 bits (one full packet at t1 rates) after a user selects the message unit, he determines the number of units in the message and he encodes this in the second block, which is 20 bits ;aide. (when selecting a message unit, a user must keep in mind that an entire message can never exceed 2 ?0 units.) by using this two level scheme, a 24-bit wide field can now specify messages that are slightly longer than 230 bits in length rather than 224 when straight decoding is used. the packet rooting protocol field is provided to the users so they can select the prp best suited for the particular message pending transmission. t?ie pi\" kft size field contains the size of the packet to be used for transmission. this parameter can be changed by the user on a r.essage-by-message basis. however, the size of s packet must remain constant throughout a message session once it has started. the last field in the message parameter block is the data rate field. users are expectea to transmit at the standard tl rate of 1,544 mb/s unless they notify the network via this parameter field. 3.5.1.3 sour ce/sink fie lds the source/sink fields are used to identify the source and sink(s) of a message. the first field is the source addrfss field. this field contains a 12-hit encoded address of the user who initiated the lep. this field does not identify the source of the control packet itself, in every instance. the controller can be the source of four types of control packets, but its address is placed in the source address tield only for hello packets. similarly, the sinks can be t.he source of two types of control packets, but their addresses are found in the source address field only for hello 56 r\\', \"packets. since each unique lep control packet can only originate from one type of node (either a source terminal, a sink or the controller) the network can always determine the type of node that generated the control packet by knowing what type of packet it is. the second field in the source/sink block is the number of sinks field. in this field the source indicates the desired number of sinks (within a range of 1 to 16). the next field, the sink address field provides the source with 16 slots (12 bits/slot) in which to place the address of each requested sink. when a sink sends a control packet, it clears this field and places its own address in the first slot. this permits the controller to determine who is the source of the response packet it has just received. the sink address field has a 17th slot that is reserved for the controller. when a source specifies that he wants a multipoint circuit, the controller issues a special 12-bit multipoint address code (mac). the controller places this mac in the query packets and in the link status packets thereby notifying the source and each sink of the special address they must use for the duration of the multipoint call. this single 12-bit address replaces the individual addresses of all the specified sinks. thus, when the source begins transmitting the actual message, he addresses each message packet with the mac rather than the actual sink addresses. when the switch sees the special code, it routes the packets to the associated sinks\\\\teach sink linked to the multipoint circuit accepts all incoming packets containing the proper mac rather than their own addresses for the duration of the call. almost 90% of the messages in the network are expected to be sent using the point-to-point mode which requires only one sink addree-. thus, 90% of the time the remaining 16 slots can be used to send. special control signals, and/or be used to send extra error detection bits (improving the probability of detecting multiple bit errors correctly). 3.5.1.4 packet overhead fields the last block of fields in the control packet is for packet overhead. these fields are required to maintain the integrity of the control packets. the first field is the packet id field which is used to tag each packet with an id number. this enables the network to keep track of the packets. the last field is the error detectio` field, which contains the bits required as overhead for an error-detection code. the code bits in this field enable the network to determine the validity of a received control packet. all control packets are 380 bits in length. the network collects the users\\' data over a 1 millisecond frame. if the users 57 ;. i\", \"are transmitting at the t1 rate of 1.544 mb/s, 1544 bits are collected in one frame. thus, at the t1 rate packets are 1544 bits long. therefore, the 330 bits must be made to fill the 1544 bit packet. pseudorandomly spreading the control packet by a factor of four yields 1520 bits. this provides 24 bits which can serve as a preamble for each packet. an important point to note is that the burst rate used on the satellite link is not t1. each user\\'s packet is burst up to the satellite within a 125 microsecond slot. using the one millisecond frame, this slot allows the network to support eight users on one channel. 10 microseconds of the slot are used as an interpacket gap leaving 115 microseconds for the actual packet transmission. thus, given the 125 microsecond dwell time with its 10 microsecond interpacket gap and the packet size of 1544 bits, the satellite link uses a burst rate of 13.4 mb/s per channel. 3.5.2 message packet format each message packet is composed of a header and a body. regardless of the body size chosen by the users, the header size remains constant. this eliminates the need for any special hardware or software to handle the headers. since the header is fixed in length for every packet, the length of the body depends on the chosen data rata and satellite beam dwell time. figure 3-13 contains the message packet fields and their bit requirements. a description of the fields follows. 3.5.2.1 the header fields the first field in the header is the packet id number field. since a user may specify a message that can have as many as 220 units (where the maximum unit length is equal to the largest packet body allowable for the given frame time and user data rate), at least 20 bits are required if each packet in the message is to have a unique id number. this field is es -titial since packets may arrive out of sequence, may not arrive at all, or may arrive with errors. without this field, sinks would be unable to reconstruct their received message from the scrambled packets, or to request the retransmission of missing or corrupted packets. the second field found in the header is the source. address field. this field contains the 12-bit encoded address of the user sending the packet. a sink requires this address whenever it must ask for a retransmission. the network could use this information for control, routing, and/or billing. 58\", \\'o u- 4j gj y u m a a, nn oj e 1 m o l wo o hq1 1-_h ^ m\\\\tm i^mpp n of nam a n\\\\tn\\\\tnu w ds w q c >wq0yumw cl x

w\\\\t muj _h q — d m cl\\\\tzq 59\\', \"the third field is the sink address field. this field consists of the 12-bit address of the sink. the network uses this address to route the packet to its final destination. in the case of multipoint calls, the multipoint address code (mac) is placed in this field. all the users of the multipoint circuit are aware of this code and will accept messages addressed with that code. the network issues the mac and is responsible for the proper routing of the packets to their multiple destinations. the fourth header field is the time stamp field. this field provides a 32-bit time stamp for the packet. packets carrying voice information are time stamped so that when they reach the sink they can be sorted. in addition to being used for sorting, the time stamp is compared to the current clock value at the sink. if the time difference exceeds a predetermined limit, the packet is discarded. when a time stamp is not required by a prp, this field is used in conjunction with the fifth field which is the error control field. the 32-bit time stamp field is concatenated with the 20-bit error control field to provide a 52-bit error-correction code. when a time stamp is necessary, only the error control field is used to hold the error-correction bits. the error control field is the last field in the packet header bringing the total length tc 96 bits. 3.5.2.2 the packet bo^y the body of the message packet consists of the data field. the data field is reserved to carry the actual text of a user\\'s message. the user is entitled to use this field to send any type of message that can be supported by an available prp. like the control packets, message packets are preceded by a 24- bit preamble and are received by the network in 1 millisecond frames. thus, if the users are transmitting at the t1 rate of 1.544 mb/s, the total packet length is 1544 bits. since the preamble is 24 bits long and the header is 96 bits wide, the packet body must be 1424 bits in length. each packet is bursted up to the satellite in 125 microsecond slots (10 microseconds of guard time and 115 microseconds transmission time) resulting in a satellite uplink burst rate of 13.4 ?lb/s. 3.5.3 ack/hack mes sage packet formats figure 3-14 displays the packet format for an ack/hack message packet. the ack/hack message packet is based on the message packet format. therefore, although the ack/tiack message packet carries out a different function, it is considered a type of message packet. 60 i 0\", \\'le\\\\tj d o c ~ w od\\\\tu y a ^? ;

share the same header format (and the same length when the data rate is t1 on the uplink in 1 millisecond frames.) as seen in figure 3-12, the first three fields in the header are identical to those in the message packet. the major difference in the ack/nack header is that the fourth field, error control, always uses the 32-bits of the time stamp field as additional error-correction bits, bringing the total to 52 bits. the primary difference in the ack/nack body is that the body is now divided into two fields rather than the single data field of a message packet. the first field, the ack/nack field, contains 32 blocks. each block is further divided into two slots. the first slot is a single bit wide. the second slot contains 20 bits. the first bit serves as the actual ack/nack word while the remaining 20 bits contain the id number of the corresponding message packet. thus, using all the ack/nack blocks, a sink may send the ack/nack responses for 32 received packets back to the source in a single ack/nack message packet. this field is 672 bits wide. assuming the sink is using the standard packet length of 1520 bits (preceded by a 24-bit preamble), the second field of the body must be 752 bits wide. this large field, the ack/nack error control field contains the error-correction bits which protect the 32 ack/nack messages. at first glance, the fact that more than half of the bits in an ack /nack message packet are used for error control may seem wasteful. however, uncorrected errors in an ack/nack message can result in either the retransmission of the wrong message packets or the destruction , by the source, of a packet that the sink never received correctly. these problems contribute to the inefficient use of network resources as well as to the degradation of system performance and reliability. by using additional overhead in control messages such as ack/nacks, system performance can be enhanced while network resources are used efficiently. 3.5.4 short ack/nack packet formats as pointed out in section 3.4.2, some prps require an ack/tack reply for each message packet received. this constraint makes the use of full size packets for ack/nack response impractical. the need for a smaller packet arises when these prps are used. figure 3-15 shows the smaller packet format used for single ack/nack replies. the entire ack/nack packet is the size of a standard message packet header (96 bits). the first field contains the 20-bit packet 1d number for the ack/nack packet itself. the second field is known as the source 62\\', \"n aw\\\\tcca w\\\\twmcl

ack/nack reply. the fourth field is the error control field. this field holds 31 error-correction bits which are used to protect the packet\\'s information bits. if there is no need for the users to tag their ack/nack packets, they can use the 20-bit packet id field as an additional error control field. this provides the users with 51 error-correction bits. the last field is the ack/nack field. this field consists of two blocks. the first block is one bit wide while the second block contains 1_0 bits. the single bit is the ack/nack word. the 20 bits found in the second block form the packet id number of the received packet for which the reply is being sent. 3.6 sizing the baseband processor the baseband processor services 16 uplink and 16 downlink beams. there are eight fixed beams and eight scanning beams for both the uplink and the downlink. the fixed beams can be implemented by using scanning beams that are programmed to scan the same coverage area continuously. all transmissions over the satellite links are synchronized within 1 millisecond frames. each frame consists of eight scanning beam dwell intervals (slots). every slot is 125 microseconds in length. ten microseconds of each slot is reserved as an interblock gap (message guard band) while the remaining 115 microseconds are used for the actual transmission. the satellite links are organized so that each uplink beam contains eight fdma channels per slot.. each downlink beam contains eight tdm channels per slot. a channel is defined as an instantaneous signal from or to a distinct user or terminal, from the satellite\\'s point of view. once assigned to a particular slot, a channel must share its slot with seven other channels. on board the satellite, there is one demodulator for each uplink channel. the downlinks have one tdm modulator per beam. since there are 16 uplink and 16 downlink beams that each support eight channels/slot, signals on 128 unique channels will be arriving at the satellite simultaneously while :26 downlink channels are also active during each slot. therefore, the baseband processor must contain 128 demodulators and 16 modulators. by using baseline assumptions concerning the beams, the throughput and switching requirements of the processor can be determined. the following assumptions are made concerning the satellite beams: 64\", \\'1.16 uplink and 16 downlink beams to be serviced by the baseband processor 2.frame period = 1 millisecond 3.8 slots per frame = >1 slot = 125 microseconds 4.8 channels per slot 5.channel capacity = 1 packet per frame the uplink throughput of the baseband processor is: total number of packets per frame = no of channelsl ino of slots, \\\\t^1 packet(no of beams) x ( \\\\tslot\\\\t 1 frame \\\\t/ x channel /beam (3-9) = (16) x (8) x (8) x (1) packets/frame = 1024 packets/frame. if we allocate one packet user, per rrame 1024 users can be serviced by the baseband processor: total number of users serviced =\\\\t 1\\\\t _nc^ of _packets \\\\t 1 _\\\\t x (\\\\tframe\\\\t- 1\\\\t1024 users \\\\t (3-10) user\\\\tframe an additional baseline assumption is that users are to transmit at an average t1 rate of 1.544 mb/s. using this value, the requirements of the satellite links and the baseband processor can now be specified in more detail. since a users data is collected over a 1 millisecond frame interval, the packet size for the t1 data rate is 1544 bits. this packet is sent over the satellite link within one slot. since the uplink slots provide the networks with a 115 microsecond transmission period, a users channel must be capable of an uplink burst rate of 13.4 mb/s. each uplink beam supports eight channels. therefore, the total uplink bandwidth per beam is 107.4 mhz if a 1 b/s/hz modulation is employed. since each downlink beam supports eight tdm channels at eight times the uplink burst rate, the downlink bandwidth per beam is also 107.4 mhz, again 65 v-!\\', \"assuming a 1 b/cycle modulation. since the processor services 1024 t1 users, the satellite throughput is 1024 x 1.544 mb/s = 1.6 gb/s. 3.7 the processor architecture figure 3-16 contains a simplified block diagram of the baseband processor. each of the 16 on-board receivers is assigned to one of the 16 uplink beams. each receiver separates and demodulates the eight fdma channels arriving within the beam for each slot. the serial bit streams from each channel pass through an input switching matrix. each matrix handles four channels. the purpose of the matrix is to ensure that every channel can be connected to a switching processor. the paths through each matrix are established by the on-board system control computer. generally, once these paths are established they remain fixed. however, if the need arises due to hardware failures, uneven traffic distributions, or related network problems, these paths can be altered on command from the master control center. table 3-3 contains all the possible interconnections provided by the switching matrices. since every switching processor provides service to one uplink channel and one downlink channel, the baseband processor employs 128 active processors. thirty-two additional switching processors are available to the baseband processor. these processors provide a 25% redundancy, bringing the total to 160 switching processors. these switching processors are implemented in the form of microprocessors which each require local read only memory- (rom), random access memory (ram) and external support hardware. the switching processors receive special control signals from the system control computer. at the on-set of each new message the orderwire processor (controller) provides protocol information, message length data, routing procedures, and special handling instructions to the proper switching processors. the controller and the system control computer communicate with one another in order to maintain synchronization. when both units are located on the satellite they are known as system control (syscon). the switching processors have four principal functions. one function is to store arriving packets in available locations in the satellite\\'s bulk memory (bm). a bulk memory controller (bmc) maintains a list of empty locations, full locations, and locations out of service. the switching processors send the bmc the addresses of locations no longer in use. in addition, when nieded, the switching processors are issued addresses of avilable locations from the bmc. while an incoming packet is being stored into an available bulk memory location, the switching processor begins its second function. this function consists of processing the packet\\'s header. 66 3 0\", \"lohn w pv l a c q y y\\\\t^0 g ma\\\\tgj^ t i\\\\t4j wo

destinations and carries out prp-related functions. after determining the packet\\'s destination, the switching processor sends this information to the first-in-first-out (fifo) controller. the fifo controller (ffc) routes each packet by placing the packet\\'s bulk memory addresses into fifo lists. each microprocessor is responsible for eight fifo lists (one for a specific channel in each of the eight downlink slots). the switching processor\\'s fourth function starts when the processors access the fifo corresponding to the current slot. if the fifo contains data, the processor fetches the oldest address in the fifo. using this address, the processor fetches a packet from bulk memory and sends it to one of the transmitters where it is beamed down to the proper sink. 3.8 processor operation in order for a user to use the baseband processor, lie must first communicate with the controller via the lep (see section 3.4.1). once in contact with the controller, the user requests a satellite link to one or more sinks. the controller checks with the system control computer to determine if the network has the required resources available for the user\\'s link. if the resources are available, the controller then checks with the desired sink(s). if the sink(s) is free, the controller establishes the message link. the link is completed when controller informs the system control computer, the user, and the appropriate switching processor. after the user is allocated the message link, he formats his message into packers and begins transmission. the operation of the baseband processor i- explained by tracing the path of one of this user\\'s packets t cough the processor. 3.8.1 point-to-point transmissions after receiving a link status packet that indicates the satellite link has been established, the user prepares for transmission. meai:while, the switching processor assigned to handle the user\\'s call is also preparing for the call. the processor carries out this preparation during the 10 microsecond interblock gap of the slot belonging to the user. during the interblock gap the processor fetches the address of an available bm location from the vic. the processor then places this address into the input address register in the ki array. 69 vt 0\", \"as the packet arrives at the demodulator it is converted into a bit stream. the packet enters the baseband processor serially through an input switching matrix. this matrix connects the output of the demodulator to the proper switching processor. at the switching processor, the serial bit stream is collected in a serial- to-parallel shift register. when this shift register is full, the 32-bit word is transferred to the data input register. this is a 32-bit parallel-in-parallel-out register. both the input address register and the data input register are connected to the bulk memory input address/data bus. a hardware pollen in the bulk memory array sequentially enables the contents of each switching processor\\'s register pair onto the bus. during this polling cycle, the address of the bulk memory is gated onto the bus from the enabled input address register. the 32-bit word of the packet is also strobed onto the bus from the selected input data .egister. the bm address decoder decodes the 13m address currently on the bus and enables one bulk memor y data latch. this latch fetches the 32- bit word from the bus and holds it until the slower bulk memory device can fetch the data from the latch. the hardware poller scans the registers of every switching processor. 32 bits are collected from the demodulators every 2.5 microseconds. thus, the hardware poller must complete each cycle once every 2.5 microseconds before the new data over-writes the old data. at the end of the entire 125 microsecond slot, every received packet has been stored in bulk memory. while each 32-bit word is being stored, the switching processor makes a copy of the packet\\'s header and stores it in local ram. after the entire header has been duplicated and stored into local ra`1, the switching processor processes the header. this processing includes all pry-related functions, error correction, and the decoding of the packet\\'s destination address. after the sink address is decoded. lhe switching processor sends it and the packet\\'s bulk memory address to a buffer in the ffc. as soon as the buffer is loaded, the processor sets a flag to indicato to the ffc polling circuit that the buffer contains valid routing information. the ffc is responsible for the proper routing of every received packet. a hardware poller scans the buffers of each active. switc^,ing processor. the contents of the enabled bui\\'fer are gated onto the fifo controller bus. the address of the packet\\'s destination is sent to a ram containing a routing table as an address for the ra`1. the contents of the ram location addressed provides the address of one of the fifo lists. since this translat ion is done in a ra`f, routing updates can easily be made by syscon. the fifo address is placed onto the fifo bus which is connected to evo r y fifo list. \\\\tthe address of the p\\'\\'1 location of the packet is sent directly from the ffc buffer to the y fifo bus. 10 3 if\", \\'when a list decodes its own address from the fifo bus, it latches *.lie bm address from the bus. once a packet\\\\\\'s bm address resides in a fifo list, it is considered routed. every switching processor has eight fifos. each fifo corresponds to one unique channel in a unique downlink slot. during the 10 microsecond interblock gaps, the processors check the fifo lists corresponding to their channel in the next slot. if a processor finds that the fifo list is not empty, the processor fetches the oldest bm address from the list. this address corresponds to the location in bulk memory which contains the oldest packet destined to the sink being serviced by the channel in the next slot. \"\\\\\\'- ;s address is placed in the output address register by the processor. working in conjunction with this register is a 32- bit wide parallel-in-serial-out register called the output data register. at the start of the transmission cycle, a hardware poller in bulk memory scans each output address register. each time the address register is polled it gates its contents (a bm address) onto the bulk memory output address/data bus. this address is supplied to each memory module. if a memory module recognizes its address on the bus, it sends the next 32-bit word of the packet it is storing to the enabled output data register via the bus. (each time an output address register is polled, its corresponding output data register is also enabled by t,. poller.) the enabled register then latches the data and begins iiiting it out serially. the serial bit stream is routed through the processor\\\\\\'s output ml:ltiplexer, through an output switching matrix, and into a 1544-bit (packet-length) serial-in-serial-out shift register. this register feeds a modulator at the rate of about 100 mb/s so that the packet can be bursted down to its sink on the selected channel within the proper slot on a tdm basis. each switching processor is actually responsible for two of the serial-in-serial-out shift registers. one is being filled in advance by the processor while the other is being emptied by the remodulator. the polling cycle in the bulk memory occurs once every 2.5 microseconds until each addressed packet is transferred out of the bulk memory 32-bits at a time and sent to the proper remodulators for transmission. this packet transfer requires forty-nine 32-bit word transfers and a total of 125 microseconds to complete. therefore, in order for a packet to be transmitted down on the desired channel during the p roper slot, it must be sent to the remodulator exactly one slot prior to its transmission. 71i 1 0\\', \"3.8.2 multiaoint transmissions after receiving a link status packet that indicates that the satellite links have been established, the user prepares for transmission. meanwhile, the switching processor assigned to handle this call is also preparing for the message transmission. during the user\\'s interblock gap, the processor fetches the address of an available bulk memory location from the bmc. this memory location must be capable of handling packets that are destined for multiple sinks. the processor then places this address into its input address register. the switching processor then sends the same address back to the bmc along with the number of sinks that the packet is destined for. the number of sinks is supplied to the processor by syscon at the onset of the link establishment. the bmc needs this information to ensure that no memory location is reused until all the specified sinks have received a copy of the multi.point packet. as a packet arrives from its demodulator, it is sent into the bulk memory array by the switching processor. while each 32-bit word is being collected and routed to the proper bm location, the switching processor makes a copy of the packet\\'s header and stores it in local ram. after the entire header has been duplicated the processor begins decoding and processing the header. the processor determines the packet\\'s mac and sends it to the buffer in the ffc along with the packet\\'s bm address. also, the multipoint alert flag is set by the processor. a hardware poller in the ffc scans each of the processor\\'s input ffc buffers. the bm address from an enabled buffer is sent directly to the fifo bus. the mac is routed to the mac decoder due to the set multipoint alert flag. the mac decoder contains a list of each fifo which is to be updated with the bm address currently on the fifo bus. this list is supplied to the ffc by syscon during the link establishment procedure. each fifo address in the list is gated onto the fifo bus one at a time for a fixed duration. the bm address remains stable on the bus throughout the entire multiple fifo update. as each fifo address appears on the bus, the corresr\\\\t-g fifo fetches the bm address and places it into the lis-\\\\t cheme permits the network to provide multipoint addles\\\\t.ing a single copy of the packet and a single sink address in the packet header. during each interblock gap, every active switching processor checks its con fifo list corresponding to its channel in the next slot. if there is a packet awaiting transmission, its bm address resides in the fifo list associated with the packet\\'s destination. after fetching the bm address of a packet, the switching processors 72\", \\'send it to their output address register in the bm array. the processors then access the bm modules and begin sending the packets to the modulators being served by the processors. multipoint packets may require \"simultaneous\" (within the same slot) bm accesses by several switching processors. therefore, special bm modules, which contain additional control hardware, are allocated for multipoint packets in order to solve the contention problems. these locations are capable of supplying more than one switching processor with a copy of the same packet within the same slot. after routing the packet from memory to the proper modulators, the switching processors return the bm address to the bmc. the bmc counts the number of times the same bm address is returned. the bmc compares this value with the number of sinks that are to receive a copy of the packet. a multipoint bm location is not released by the bmc until a copy of the packet at that location has been sent to every specified sink. 3.8.3 implemen tation of the baseband pr ocessor the architecture and the chip-level implementation of the baseband processor/packet switch presented in this report represent one possible system design. this design may or may not be an optimal solution. however, using this design as a guideline, power consumption can be estimated, an approximate chip count can be made, and most importantly, technology requirements for future on-board satellite processing capabilities can be identified. 3.8.3.1 the bulk memor y controller the bmc has three major tasks: 1.to monitor the status of every bulk memory location. 2.to accept the addresses of unneeded bm locations from the switching processors. 3.to provide the addresses of available bm locations to the switching -?rocessors on demand. figure 3-17 contains a block diagram of the bmc. all switching processors are required to return the address of a bm location they have been accessing whenever-. 1.\\\\tthey are not scheduled to receive an incoming packet in the next slol. 73 if\\', \"uz roj az avaz iur nognf ^ ns 3 w 0 \\'^ a ~ / qj q wwf m ^w ad ^oa jas z sgy ^ m 5rroi. cov l o e fy r m g1

receive a multipoint packet (requiring a multipoint bm location). in summary, the switching processors are only allowed to retain the address of a bm location when the location previously held a point- to-point packet and a point-to-point packet will be stored there within the next slot. when a switching processor returns a bm address to the bmc, it sends it to a data register in the bmc. the processor then sets a polling flag to indicate that the register contains valid data. a hardware polling circuit scans the flag of every data register in search of full registers. when the poller finds an active flag it halts, enables the output of the register and notifies the bmc control processor. the control processor fetches the address and stores it in a list containing the addresses of all available bm locations freed by the switching processors. this list resides in dedicated ram. after the address has been stored, the control processor restarts the poller. if the address returned to the kic belongs to a multipoint bm location, the control processor does not store it with the other addresses. instead, the control processor sends it to a second control processor in the bmc. the second control processor is responsible for the handling of multipoint bm addresses. this processor counts the number of times a multipoint bm address is returned. each time the count is incremented, the processor compares the value to the number of sinks that are to receive a copy of the packet stored at that bm location. this control processor is supplied with the number of sinks for a given packet by the switching processor that first received the multipoint packet. the switching processor sends the b`1 address of the packet, along with the number of sinks that are waiting for the packet, to a special data register in the bmc. the switching processor then sets a polling flag to indicate that the register contains valid bm reuse information. when the poller finds the active flag it halts and notifies the second control processor. this control processor fetches the contents from the enabled register. the number of sinks is then stored at a location in ram that is addressable by decoding the multipoint bm address of the packet. each time a multipoint b\"1 address is returned to the bmc, the second control processor accesses the value stored at the location 75 0\\', \\'addresssed by the bm address and decrements it. when the value at a given location reaches zero, the bm address used to address that value is returned to the first control processor. once returned to the first control processor, the bm address is placed into the list of available bm locations. it is now ready to be re-issued to a switching processor on demand. when a switching processor needs the address of an available memory module, it checks its output data register in the bmc. if the register contains a valid bm address, the processor fetches this address and sets a flag to indicate the register is now empty. otherwise, the processor must wait for the register to be filled by the bmc. a hardware poller scans the output data registers for the bmc. whenever an empty register is encountered, the first control processor is notified. this control processor refills the register with either the address of an available point-to-point or multipoint bm location, according to what was requested. the processor then restarts the poller. 3.8.3.2 the bulk memory array the function of the bulk memory array is to hold all received packets until they can be routed and sent to the proper sink(s). e the input side the block diagram of the input side of the bulk memory array is shown in figure 3-18a. there are 160 dedicated input buffers servicing the switching processors. these buffers are attached to the input address/data bus which services the 1320 memory modules. the total number of memory modules is based on the following assumptions: i.\\\\tthe number of buffers to handle steady state traffic is: bmss\\\\t(2 + -0 x 128 = 704 buffers. 2.\\\\tthe number of additional buffers required to handle statistical fluctuations (500) is:r, bm sf = bmss x 0.50 = 352 buffers.

to achieve a 23% redundancy is: bm  = (bm ss + bmsf) x 0.25 = 264 buffers. therefore, the total number of memory modules is: bm t = bmss + bmsf + bm r = 1320 buf fers . in assumption (1) the factor of 2 is due to the fact that, ideally a processor should only need a two bm locations: one to hold an outgoing packet and one to receive an incoming packet. however, since there are eight slots/frame, a packet may be forced to remain on-board the satellite for as long as eight slots (one complete frame). this leads to the factor of (28/8) found in assumption (1). the number 128 is based on the number of channels. assumption (2) is based on providing a 50 redundancy for safely handling most statistical fluctuations. assumption (3) is based on the idea that the satellite should be provided with a 25 redundancy of key hardware to by-pass hardware failures that shorten the useful life of satellites. of the 1320 memory modules, 132 are assigned to handle multipoint packets. again the number 132 is based on assumptions (1) through (3) for the condition that up to 10% of the 128 channels may use the multipoint function. thus, the number 132 is calculated as follows: bmmp = 10% 4 1320 = 132 multipoint buffers the switching processcrs send the packets to the b 11 array in the form of 32-bit words which are arriving at the rate of one word per 2.6 microseconds. a hardware poller enables one input buffer onto the bus at one *.ime. the buffers contents include a bm address and a 32-b 4l packet word. the address is decoded and used to enable a single hulk memory data latch. this latch fetches the packet word from the bus in approximately 10 nanoseconds. it then sends the slower bulk memory device eight 4-bit blocks, one at a time. a block is sent to the memory device once every 320 nanoseconds, which is a reasonable access time for standard memory 78 e,* \\'3\", \\'devices. at the end of one slot, forty-nine 32-bit transfers have taken place for each incoming packet. • the output side figure 3-18b contains the block diagram of the output side of the bulk memory array. on the output side of the bm array there are 160 dedicated output buffers servicing the switching processors. these buffers are attached to the output address/data bus. whenever a switching processor is required to transmit a packet, it must place the packet\\\\\\'s bm address into the buffer. a hardware puller enables one buffer onto the bus at one time, the address is decoded and used to select a single bulk memory output data latch. this latch places its contents (3 32-bit packet word) onto the bus. this word is then strobed into the data portion of the enabled output buffer. this data is then shifted out serially and is routed to the proper modulator by the switching processor. after the contents of the latch are emptied onto the bus, the latch fetches the next eight 4-bit blocks from the memory device. the latch is completely reloaded in 2.6 microseconds and ready to be accessed again as the poller completes its cycle. this operation continues until the packet-length shift registers in the modulators are filled and ready for the transmission cycle. this requires 125 microseconds. if a multipoint bm module i., being addressed, a slightly different operation is required during a memory read cycle. all multipoint bm locations have d,)uble output data latches. the data is held stable in one latch for the duration of one polling period (2.6 microseconds). this permits more than one switching processor to fetch a copy of the same packet during the same slot interval. while the latch being read is held stable, the other latch is being loaded with the next word. when the poller finishes one complete scan of the switching processors\\\\\\' output buffers, the newly filled latch is multiplexed onto the bus. the \"emptied\" latch is now refilled. this operation continues until a copy of the packet has been sent to every requesting switching processor. 3.8.3.3 the fifo controller the fifo controller is responsible for the routing of all packets that have been received by the baseband processor. in order to carry out this task, the ffc must be provided with the packets\\\\\\' destinations and their locations in the b`1 array. a block diagram of the ffc is shown in figure 3-19a. after a switching processor decodes a packet\\\\\\'s header, it sends the packet\\\\\\'s destination address to the ffc buffer. along with this address, the switching processor sends the b 11 address of the packet. 79 r f\\', \"n g v l lq l kyr m gl hnw z yjnw q q

receive a packet during a slot interval, it simply clears the buffer, indicating the absence of new routing information. a hardware poller enables the output of one of these buffers at a time. the packet\\\\\\'s bm address is sent directly to the fifo bus. attached to this bus is every fifo list in the baseband processor. if the multipoint alert flag for the enabled buffer is not set, the packet\\\\\\'s destination address is routed to the point-to-point address decoder. the point-to-point address decoder is shown in figure 3-19b. • point-to-point routing the point-to-point address decoder contains two address translation tables. the tables convert the actual sink addresses into fifo list addresses. eight unique fifo lists are serviced by each active switching processor. in turn, each switching processor services a unique channel that broadcasts to the sinks awaiting the packets listed in the processor\\\\\\'s fifos. due to changing traffic conditions, hardware outages, and other network-related problems, these translation tables may require periodic updating. the use of duplicate tables allows a syscon update of one table, while the other remains operational. this allows continuous operation without an interruntion in service to the users. also, the use of two tables provides a 50% redundancy in hardware to reduce the possibility of a fatal hardware failure. (updates to the single surviving table would cause temporary delays in service.) the operation of the decoder is straightforward. the sink address is used to address a location in the active conversion table. the contents of the addressed location are sent to the fifo bus along with the already stabilized packet b\"1 address. all the fifo lists monitor the fifo bus. when a list recognizes its address on the bus, it fetchs the b`1 address. the bm address is then placed into the list in a first-in-first-out fashion resulting in the transmission of the oldest packets first. once a packet\\\\\\'s address has been placed into a fifo list the packet is considered routed. • `fultipoint routing when the multipoint alert flag of an enabled buffer is set, the packet\\\\\\'s mac is routed to the mac decoder. this decoder is shown in figure 3-19c. 52 ti\\', \\'w-wo qooc wnn \\\\t w-,gyp w m gu•j r^ u fq z ar ^ d ow a q j gd x x n nnnw •q s`u. o < ^ d qjyf ^w yw- 6, o m d n w xr ^ w ^ n zw0 ^v q h q 41 c pai j\\\\t 1 •r o la c0u o r-- m qi 11.qcc¢wnn n wi j dr ^\\\\t 8\\\\t u hqqrw\\\\t q\\\\t oq 0 83\\', \"j o^►\\' it jn, 78 u tiou v1 lv 4 41 cl lo ol cou o ti v_ v r m 01x xpra^ rw jo8aw c ru^w - \\'l o 0 o w w y cw  s\\\\tyu j\\\\tw lo\\\\t 0< 0= a\\\\t % mi0 mi d q i a\\\\t a aga  g r w\\\\to 0 0 i w\\\\t=w 4. ^w \\'^ o 84 t;\", \\'the mac decoder contains 12 conversion tables which each hold 16 fifo addresses. included in the decoder system is a mac decoding control processor. this processor is responsible for polling synchronization for the ffc, updating the mac conversion tables, and providing control during the mac conversions. during a multipoint link establishment procedure, syscon sends the mac decoding procesor a copy of the mac issued to the users and the list of fifo addresses that correspond to the current users of the issued mac. the control processor places the list of fifo addresses into the mac conversion table selected for the issued mac. since the lep protocol allows up to 16 sinks per multipoint call, each table holds 16 fifo addresses. unused locations are cleared by the processor. once the mac table is prepared an y the multipoint packets begin to arrive, the operation of the mac decoder begins. the mac is used to address the proper table. after the ram containing the selected table is enabled, the mac decoding processor begins to cycle through the 16 table locations. each fii70 address leaving the ram is sent to the fifo bus. here, it is held stable long enough for the addressed fifo to recognize its address and to latch the bm address on the bus. this is done until all 16 fifo addresses have been placed on the bus. (fifo list address zero is not used so that table locations cleared by the control processor do not disrupt fifo updating when placed on the bus.) •\\\\tthe ffc poller the ffc polling circuit is presented in figure 3-19d. this circuit is clocked by the mac decoding control processor. the function of the polling circuit is to enable one fifo buffer belonging to an active switching processor for the duration of the decoding/routing cycle. the poller is disabled for 1 microsecond of every slot interval. during this time, every active switching processor is accessing one of its eight fifo lists. with the ffc in a halt cycle, the switching processors can read their fifo lists without their being updated simultaneously, which would result in unstable data. the use of the halt cycle leaves the poller 124 microseconds in which to cycle through the 128 active fifo buffers. however, tae poller may actually have less time than this. up to 12 of the 128 fifo buffers may contain multipoint routing information. each multipoint packet may have up to 16 destinations. therefore, as many as 308 decode/route cycles may be carried out by the ffc. each cycle must be accomplished in 400 nanoseconds.=_:z w 85 r 0\\', \\'89q q^y q n 01u j nlnw r 0. a s lclrrol co u o r m q1 ll.j t! n nj jq qz z n 1/^ . +•86 i 0\\', \\'the mac decoding control processor clocks the poller once very 400 nanoseconds for each point-to-point packet encountered. if the buffer ,just enabled contains multipoint routing data, the poller is held at that address until the 16 mac decodings have been carried out. since the number of deco-,,•haute cycles may range from 128 to 308 in each slot interval, thr \"ic decoding control processor must monitor the polling cycle. when the poller reaches the last buffer, the control processor must decide whether or not to allow the poller to start the next polling cycle. if all of the allocated 124 microseconds have been used by 308 decode/route cycles, the poller is restarted (after the 1 microsecond halt cycle for the switching processor read operation). if less than 308 decode/route cycles were required during the slot interval, the control processor holds the poller stable until it is time to start the next slot. the ffc poller, unlik e• the fast bm polle.rs, operates at a fairly low duty cycle (even when cycling at its maximum rate). this allows the use of memory which holds a list of the active devices that require polling. unlike the bm pollers which must poll all 160 switching processors, the ffc poller is selective. two rams contain the list of active switching processors. one ram contains the list currently in use while the other serves as backup. (the use of two lists also allows syscon to update the lists without interruption, whenever a switching processor assignment is changed.) each time the polling circuit is clocked, the address of the next device to be polled is strobed out of memory. the ram locations are addressed sequentially by a counter. the output of the ram drives a decoder which selects the single device being polled. 3.8.3.4 the snitching processors a single switching processor is shown in figure 3-20. the switching processors are implemented by general purpose microprocessors, ram, rom, and control logic. each processor supports its own input/output (1/0) bus. this bus permits the processors to interface with the ffc, the bmc, the 13 11-1 array, and their own fifo lists. the processors receive signals from syscon via a dedicated channel. also, each processor has dedicated lines linking it to the demodulator and modulator it is serving. the processors carry out their switching tasks at a moderated rate executing a small number of instructions. 87 0\\', \"s w yj a > c ^^qi tic•  a >¢ \\' ova w o y q y —y r-. >¢ &ownn2viaywo fula, •\\\\t c01 o iw► ww y r 7j td qwy.w m w w r,--.n s 88 ^-3iii\", \\'3.9 technology implications this section summarizes a survey of both current and forthcoming electronic device technologies suitable for the design and ultimate impler.,entation of the digital baseband processor. an update of the current state of the art for several of the more promising device technologies, with representative commercially available examples, is provided. some of the more conservative projections of the state of the art into the coming decade, as bared upon the technology development trends over the past decade, are presented. promising new options that are now or will soon be available for inclusion into processor design are considered. 3.9.1 baseband processor data rates quantitative requirements to be met by the electronic devices employed in the processor design are established in a short review of the pertinent baseband data rates and times. the proposed satellite design has 16 uplink and 16 downlink antenna beams. in each set of 16 beams, eight beams are assigned to fixed, high-traffic areas, and the other eight beams are used in a cyclical scanning mode. each of the eight scanning beams visits eight coverage areas, providing complete conus coverage with a total of 64 coverage areas. with a coverage area dwell time of 125 µ s, each scanning beam has a frame time of 1 ms. of the total channel capacity of each coverage area, a fraction equivalent to eight tl- carriers (t1: 1.544 mb/s) will be handled by the baseband processor. accordingly, each antenna beam will have a baseband capacity of ;sixty-four t1-carriers, or about 98.8 \"ib/s pe- beam, leading to a total satellite baseband capacity of almost 1.6 gb/s. for the uplink, an fdma approach was selected with eight fdm channels (of about 12.4 mb/s per channel) for the scanned beams and eight or more fdm channels for the fixed beams. the 12.4 mb/s channel width accommodates one t1-carrier when bursted at eight times the normal bit rate since the coverage area dwell time is one- eighth of the frame time. for the downlink, a tdm broadcast approach was selected to carry the 98.8 mb/s beam capacity which results from bursting eight t1-carriers (per coverage-area dwell) at eight times the normal tl rate. that is, each of the eight output channels routed by the baseband processor to a given downlink beam modulator has a data rate of 12.4 mb/s. if the output channels are byte-wid •(r bits) data busses, then the output channel data rate is 1.544 x 106 89\\', \\'(1-byte) words/s. if two 64-bit shift registers, operated in ping- pong fashion, are alternately parallel loaded with eight 8-bit words every 0.648 ns ( = 1/fml), they can alternately be serially shifted out to the modulator at the desired 98.8 mb/s rate. 3.9.2 major areas requiring state-of-the-art lsi technology there are three major areas in the design of the satellite- borne baseband digital processor which depend heavily on state-of- the-art lsi technology: •\\\\t \\\\tdemodulation of the fdma uplink beams into serial bit or byte data streams 9\\\\t baseband digital processing of these data streams •\\\\t \\\\tremodu1ation of the processed and routed data streams into tdm downlink beams consideration of some of the major aspects of these areas serves to introduce the specific devices which are dealt wi-_h in later sections. since there are 16 beams, each with at least eight frequency division multiplex (fdm) channels, there will be at least 128 input (and 128 output) channels in the baseband processor. one should thus be mindful of this high degree of channel replication multiplicity when choosing a specific device to implement a channel function. 3.9.2.1 lsi requirements in demodulation and remodulation after demodulation of the baseband component of each uplink beam, each of the eight-channel demodulators will deliver a 12.4 mb/s serial data stream. by using an 8-bit wide serial-to-parallel conversion shift register, the channel data bus delivers one byte every 0.648/1s. prior to remodulation, a 64-bit wide parallel-to- serial conversion shift register is used to produce the 98.8 mb/s data stream from the one byte per 0.648 p s outputs of the eight channels routed to the given remodulator. as to the demodulation and remodulation processes themselves, several attractive analog and digital methods can be considered. .. among the analog approaches are use of charge-coupled devices (ccds), surface acoustic wave devices (sawds), and transferred electron logic devices (telds). digital demodulation involves analog-to-digital conversion and (sometimes) sample-and-hold k\\\\t circuitry. digital remodulation involves digital-to-analog 4\\\\t conversion and perhaps some filtering. both digital demodulation 90 ti 10\\', \\'and digital remodulation require byte -by-byte multiplication of data with local oscillator signals, whether explicitly by combinatorial- logic parallel multipliers and associated accumulators, or implicitly via, e .g., the cordic rotation algorithm implemented on an ic chip. 3.9.2.2 lsi requirements in baseband processing depending upon the level of functional complexity desired, the baseband processor dasign will include some (or all) of the following representorive features: •\\\\theader extraction/processing •\\\\ttraffic routing (according to header information) •\\\\tdata channel multiplexing/demultiplexing •\\\\tqueueing •\\\\ttraffic prioritization •\\\\tinterim (i.e., intra rcv/xmt) data storage •\\\\tdown-link scanning beam delay •\\\\thigh-channel -rate queueing •\\\\tlow priority traffic •\\\\terror managment •\\\\theader bits - fec •\\\\t \\\\tpacket data - arq (with processor -recalculated crc word) •\\\\tencryption of (broadcast) downlink transmission 3.9.2.3 power -- dominant criterion? although the size of the channel memory and the high-level i\\\\t \\\\t performance of the processor logic, together with the speed of both, are clearly very important considerations, the limited power available on board the satellite and the rather large number (2126) of channel replications cause device power to assume almost dominant importance. 91 i^\\', \"if, for example, 1.28 kw (so as to yield a round-number final value) is available for demodulation, baseband processing and remodulation, then a power-budget of 10 w/channel results. it is this number against which a candidate device or component must be compared to assess feasibility and appropriateness of incorporation into channel design. thus, unless all other components are exceptionally low power devices, a fast multiplier approach consuming 5w cannot be reasonably justified. 3.9.3 overview of lsi technolo three categories of lsi technology development are of direct interest to the design of the satellite digital baseband processor. the first concerns technologies which are currently well advanced and which may, where suitable, be relied upon here and now. it is these technologies that form the basis for the technology projections into the future. the second category concerns technologies with near-term promise (mid 1980\\'s?). reasonable and conservative extrapolation of tts results of the past decade suggests that the expected products of these technologies are worth tentative incorporation into the baseband processor design. the third category concerns technologies with far-term promise (early 1990\\'s?). these technologies, extremely attractive in what they promise, are still in their infancy and extrapolation of curre!it laboratory results into the next decade is divination at best. although such technologies cannot be relied upon for current designs, neither can they be ignored. 3.9.3.1 presently well-advanced device technologies devices of interest are mainly lsi-level logic and memory chips although a few special processing chips are also considered. at present, silicon devices dominate the integrated circuit (ic) picture, but inroads are being made by gallium arsenide in the area of low-power gigabit/second devices. also, thin magnetic bubble domains are entering into the very-high-density memory picture as are compounds such as quartz and lithium niobate in signal processing. integrated circuits fabricated with silicon utilize both bipolar and field-effect transistor technologies, but gallium arsenide integrated circuits use only the field-effect transistor technology. 92\", \\'bipolar devices bipolar devices, whose transistor action is associated with pn- junctions and minority-carrier current dynamics, are generally the faster of the available devices, but also are the highest in power dissipation. having the reatest radiation hardness, bipolar ics form the main military technology. some of the more common bipolar transistor logic families are described below. ttl (transistor-transistor logic). probably the most prevalent bipolar logic family today, ttl technology is used in a wide variety of small scale integration (ssi)- and medium scale integration (msi)-chip logic functions where its relatively high power dissipation is tolerable. in addition, for these applications as well as for memories in particular, lower-power (l) and faster, schottky-diode-camped (preventing collector saturation) (s) versions of the ttl technology more suited to lsi are often available. a typical, currently available ttl 4k ram has a 30 ns access time and dissipates about 850 mw (about 210 p w/bit). a megabit of this type of memory would accordingly dissipate over 200 w. i2l (integrated injection logic). this form of bipolar logic lends itself well to lsi with its high packing density ( 150 gates/mm ) and low power/delay-time product (-1 pj). 1-l is a low voltage (1-v supply, 0.6-v transitions) current-steering technology. the base currents of several gate input transistors, supplied by the collector of a single transistor acting as a constant-current source (injection-current, bus), can be shorted out (or left alone) by the gate input signals. for low to moderate injection current levels, the switching response time is inversely proportional to the power dissipation (controlled by the injection current level), which provides a useful speed-power trade-off design option. ibm has recently reported significant improvement in their i 21, technology. using 2.5 pm design rules, they have achieved average switching speeds of 0.8 ns (or a maximum toggle frequency of 625 mhz) at 100 n a per gate which translates into a dissipation of approximately 100 n w per gate, yielding a speed-power product of about 0.08 pj. ecl (emitter coupled log \\\\t. ecl is the fastest of all the silicon logic families and also dissipates the most power. the heart of the ecl gate is an emitter-coupled differential amplifier in which several parallel, common-collector input transistors drive the output common-base transistor. the collector loads are selected so that no collectors enter saturation. this provides very fast (typically sub-nanosecond) switching action but at the price of relatively high power dissipation per gate. typically, very fast bit-slice architecture designs employ ecl. a typical, currently 93\\', \\'available ecl lk ram has a 12 ns address access time and dissipates about 500 mw (50011w/bit). a megabit of this type of memory would accordingly dissipate 500 w. thus, ecl must be used very selectively, if at all, in this satellite application. fet devices fet devices are based on field effect transistor action in which potentials on the high-impedance gate electrode modulate the flow of the majority-carrier current between the source and drain electrodes. the method of gate isolation employed gives rise to two major categories of devices. in one category, devices whose gates are isolated from the conduction channel by means of a reverse- biased pn junction are known as junction field-effect transistors: jfets or simply flts. jfets are called mesfets when the reverse- biased isolation junction is a metal-semiconductor rectifying contact (i.e., schottky barrier). devices in the other category, whose thin-film metallic gate electrodes are isolated from the (semiconductor) conduction channel by means of a thin layer of dielectric insulation, are in general called either misfets or igfets: _metal-insulator-se-ri--onductor or insulated gate fets. when, as is most commonly the case, the dielectric material is an oxide, the devices are then called mosfets: metal-oxide-semiconductor fets. among fet devices, there is an important further dichotomy based on the nature of the conduction channel. the fet whose channel is fully conductive at zero bias (e.g., a channel diffused or ion-implanted into the substrate), and is made less conductive (depleted) by reverse biasing the gate, is called a depletion-mode fet or sometimes dfet. fets, whose channel is unformed at zero bias, and is created (with forward gate biasing) by inducing an inversion layer near the oxide-semiconducto- interface, are called enhancement-mode fets or sometimes ehfets. fet devices dissipate subetantially less power than bipolar devices but are generally somewhat slower, although the speed gap is narrowing (and sometimes even closed). some of the more common fet logic families are described below. pmos (p-channel mosfets). pmos technology was first to be developed because most of the contaminants in mos fabrication are mobile ions which are positively charged and are easily trapped in the oxide layer that insulates the gate from the substrate. in p-channel devices, these positive contaminant ions, due to negative gate biasing, are collected at the metal (gate)-oxide interface and have little effect on the channel. in n-charnel devices, however, 94\\', \\'the positive contaminants collect along the oxide-semiconductor interface and induce a shift in bias which causes the transistor to turn on prematurely. the more extensive process control required to fabricate comparable n-channel devices initially made th m uneconomical. the intrinsically superior performance of n-channel devices, however, prompted research in fabrication technology which ultimately resulted in pmos logic being supplanted by nmos in all but the simplest and least-expensive consumer products. nmos (n-channel mosfets). nmos logic is superior to pmos because the electron mobility in silicon is more than 2.5 times the hole mobility; this ultimately translates into a speed advantage for nmos. for the same operating conditions, pmos resistivity will be 2.5 times higher, requiring 2.5 times higher areas to achieve the same resistance. accordingly, nmos packing densities can be made larger, for the same complexity, and thus faster in switching due to the smaller junction areas and resultant smaller capacitances that figure into the internal rc time constants that directly limit device operating speed. a representative state-of-the-art nmos microprocessor, the motorola mc68000, has some 13,000 gates (with over 70,000 active elements) on an approximately 6mm x 7mm chip using 3.2 pm minimum features, and dissipates 1.2 w at an 8 mhz clock rate. a representative nmos static ram of 16 kbit capacity with 80 ns address access time dissipates about 190 mw (11.9 n w/bit.)\\\\tone megabit of this type memory would then dissipate about 12 w. cmos (complementary mos). in complementary mos logic, both nmos and pmos enhanc< ,ment mode transistors are used on the same chip to produce a logic family whose standby (i.e., inter-logic- transition) power dissipation is extremely low. the use of both channel polarities is achieved by diffusing or ion-implanting wells of polarity opposite to that of .ae substrate, effectively creating local islands of opposite polarity substrate. thus, with an n-type substrate, pmos transistors are made on the direct substrate, and nmos ones are made on the p-type islands or wells. if pmos and nmos transistors are stacked in series between a power supply and ground with gates tied together, there is no appreciable quiescent current (nor, therefore. power dissipation) through the stacked transistors since only one or the other can conduct. if there is stray capacitive loading at the inter-drain tie-point between the two transistors. one or the other transistor will supply a brief charging current pulse to alter the voltage across the stray capacitance. thus cmos logic is characterized by extremely low steady-state power dissipation and dynamic power dissipation that increases with increasing clock rate. another important benefit of complementary mos logic is that of equal drive 95 nr\\', \\'power for either polarity transition versus, for example, active pull-down and passive pull-up common in other logic families. in addition to its low power dissipation qualities, cmos possesses the further advantages of high noise immunity, wide tolerance to power supply variation and low temperature sensitivity. despite its lower static power dissipation (previously not too important) cmos has trailed nmos in density and speed development because the cmos process is somewhat more involved. cmos is usually considered to be slower than nmos when its less well-developed density, and therefore speed, is not taken into consideration. actually, however, for a given patterned gate line width, cmos is about twice as fast as nmos. with the drive to very large scale integration (vlsi) and greatly increased interest in minimizing power dissipation. cmos development is advancing rapidly. a representative cmos microprocessor, the rca cdp1802, has an 8-bit internal data bus, a sixteen 16-bit-register general purpose register file, and a 91 instruction repertoire. with a 5 v supply, it dissipates 0.5 mw quiescently and 6 mw at a 3.2 mhz clocking rate; or, with a 10 v supply, it dissipates 5 mw quiescently and 40 mw at a 6.4 mhz clocking rate. this contrasts dramatically with a typical (though somewhat more powerful) nmos microprocessor such as the ia?el 8085a, which dissipates 850 mw at a 5 mhz clocking rate. also, a representative cmos 16-kbit static ram with 100 ns address access time dissipates 200 mw (12.5 p w/bit) at full cycle rate, but only 1 mw (0.063 nw/bit) quiescently. thus, a 1 mbit cmos me..,ory would dissipate 12.5 w at full cycle rate but only 63 mw quiescently. cmos/sos (silicon on sapphire). the previously described type of cmos logic is k,:own as bulk cmos since it is fabricated on a silicon substrate, into which the various transistor elements are diffused or ion implanted. these elements are dc-isolated from the bulk substrate since they are biased se as to form reverse-biased pn-_junctions. they are, however, capacitively coupled to the (semiconductive) substrate through the pn-junction depletion region capacitance. this stray capacitance serves to reduce the switching speed. if a thin film of n-type silicon is hetero-epitaxially deposited on a dielectric substrate of sapphire, however, with transistor elements formed by.polarity-reversing amounts of diffused or ion-implanted doping, then the capacitive coupling of transistor elements to the substrate is greatly reduced. the reduced capacitive loads permit lower current-drive de.-igns and thereby smaller and more densely packed transistors. this capacitive adv-,ntage is somewhat offset by the reduction of the majority carrier mobility from the bulk value to the surface 96 11 3 0\\', \"value, which results, in turn, in a reduced transiztor gain constant. also, the standby leakage current in currently fabricated cmos/sos is much higher. although cmos/sos is at present a more difficult and expensive technology, it holds a substantial advantage in gate power, and is expected to play a significant role in the advance to i:lsi. currently available cmos/sos static rams include an rca 4 kbit one with 650 ns access and 0.25 mw (0.063/tw/bit) power dissipation, and a 16 kbit one (recently announced) with 80 ns access and 14 mw (0.88 aw/bit) dissipation at full cycle rate and spw quiescent dissipation. with the latter type cmos/sos memory, a 1 mbit memory would dissipate 880 mw at full cycle rate and 310 p w quiescently. mno_s (metal-nitride-oxide-semiconductor). when the previously treated logic family technologies are used to fabricate memory arrays, the memories thus formed are all volatile: they lose all information content upon powering down. nonvolatility can be introduced into a semiconductor memory through the mechanism of charge trapping. one of the earliest approaches to realize this replaced the simple oxide gate-insulation layer with a composite o oxide-nitride layer. a very thin silicon dioxide layer (e.g., 20 a) was deposited on the substrate over the fet channel area, followed by a thicker silicon nitride layer (e.g., 600 a ), and in turn by the conductive gate-electrode layer. this nitride layer contained charge-trapping centers which would immobilize any charges that could be brought to them. by application of relatively high potentials (25-30 v) to the gate electrode, charges from the substrate could be induced, by quantum mechanical (fowler-nordheim) tunneling, to traverse the thin oxide layer and become trapped in the nitride trapping centers near the oxide-nitride interface. high reverse-polarity potentials could reverse this process. the trapped charges exert the same effect on the fet channel below them as a potential permanently applied to the gate electrode. for instance, if the trapped-charge potential strongly off-biases the fet, then applicatioa of a normal-level gate strobe would fail to make the fet conduct, and vice-versa in the absence of any trapped-charge off-bias. use of the trapped charge mechanism to achieve nonvolatility introduces two further memory parameters: retention and endurance. retention relates to how long, (typically years) the trapped charge takes to leak away when there have been fewer than, e.g., 10-100 erase/rewrite cycles. endurance relates to how many (typically 10-100 k) erase/rewrite cycles it takes to \\'stress-fatigue\\' s the nitride layer so that the charge/no-charge thresholds are no longer different enough to provide error-free memory readout. 97\", \"due to the relatively limited number of erase/write operations inherent in mnos-based memories, they are generally referred to as earoms: electrically alterable read-only memories. currently available earoms are relatively slow in readout times (typically \\',is or more) -- and extremely slow in erase/write cycle times (typically 10-100 ms). most presently require several power supplies, although this may be remedied in newer designs. they do permit both single-word as well as block erasure, and, what is most important, allow it to be done within the circuit. a representative earom has a 4 kbit capacity, 900 ns read access time, 10 ms erase/write cycle, 10 yr retention, 10 5 cycle endurance, and requires +5 v and -12 v supplies, dissipating 450 mw when operating. famos/flotox. in addition to the mnos approach to nonvolatile memory, there are processes called v mos: floating-gate avalanche- injection mos, and flotox: floating-gate t1innel oxide. as their process names indicate, the gate electrode is, electrically floating, surrounded by the silicon dioxide gate insulation material. there are several mechanisms by which charge can be made to traverse the oxide layer and become stored on the flo?zing gate electrode. in one approach, back-biasing the drain-substrate junction with a high (e.g., 25-30 v) voltage initiates an avalanche discharge and some of the resultant high-energy electrons burrow through the thin oxide layer to the floating gate electrode. in another approach, producing an intense electric field between a control gate electrode (above, and oxide-insulated from, the floating gate) and the substrate enables electrons to traverse the oxide layer by quantum mechanical tunneling. in either event, the charges stored on the floating gate electrode have an effect on the fet thresholds similar to the nitride-trapped charge effect 4n the mnos case. when the resulting memory device is provided with a quartz window and is erased by ultra violet (uv)-induced photoconductivity within the oxide layer, the device is called either a uv-eprom or just eprom: erasable programmable rom. when erasable by a reverse- polarity electric field, the memory device is called an eeprom: _electrically erasable prom. in the interest of completeness, it might also be pointed out that the term rom, read-only _memory, beside denoting the generic memory category also implies factory (mask) programming; and the term prom, programmable rom, similarly denotes the generic memory category and implies user or field (fused link) programmability as well. a representative (industry standard) 16k uv-eprom has a 350-450 ns access time and requires only a single +5 v supply, dissipating 550 mw when operating. by uv illumination, block (but not single byte) erasure is effected in 15-30 minutes. although the range of eeprom devices is not yet as wide as uv-eproms, their 98 i 0\", \"access times and retention are comparable. their erase time is much shorter, a minute or less, but present devices use special voltages and complex voltage sequencing, making them impractical for in- circuit programming. they are also block-only erasable. gallium arsenide (msij semiconductor technology has been dominated by devices fabricated from silicon. the industry has progressed from the single transistor to the monolithic integrated circuit and then on to large scale integration of thousands of devices on a single chip. the widespread use of silicon ics is attributable for the most part to the industry\\'s achievement of nearly doubling the density of operational functions per chip each year, and at a lower cost per function. as a result, applications of silicon lsi chips are growing at an enormous rate, and a new revolution in the form of vlsi is rapidly becoming possible, with subsystems, and even entire systems, placed on a single chip. emerging from the background of the silicon lsi/vlsi revolution, however. gallium arsenide (gaas) is gradually gaining momentum. it may well become the major contender to the dominance of silicon technology, with potential gigabit circuitry having gate switching times of less than 100 ps and dynamic switching energies of less than 0.1 pj. consequently, gnas is of steadily mounting importance for its potential in the vlsi picture. application of silicon ics, particularly lsi chips, has so far been limited to relatively low data rates and has yet to invade the microwave regime.. various silicon ic technologies, including cmos/sos, nmos and (bipolar) ecl, generally have gate propagation delays oft ns or more. except for a few small-scale ecl applications (e.g., high speed prescalers), clock rates and function execution times are well under gigabit rates. in contrast, however, gaas digital ?cs made with depletion-mode mesfets and schottky diodes have demonstrated kate propagation delays of less than 200 ps, breaking the gigabit barrier and moving directly into the microwave area. the low-power, high speed advantage of gaas mesfet ics stems directly from the high electron mobility and semi- insulating substrate of the gaas mesfet, which gives it high transconductance and unity current gain bandwidths of nearly 80 go for 1 pm gate devices (compared with ;about 12 gliz for a similar si mesfet). these same properties, of course, are the basis for the current attention being given to the development and use of discrete microwave gaas fets. since the prin(.ipal advantage of gaas is its high electron (but small hole) mobility, a feature best exploited in a majority-carrier 99 r\", \"device technology, most gaas ic efforts have been based on the use of n-channel fets of various types. of these, the schottky diode fet logic (sdfl) structure, whic\\', ::---!!s high speed schottky diodes for most logic functions, and 1 power depletion mode mesfets for inversion and gain, holds great promise for lsi circuit application. sdfl achieves speeds (td = 75 ps) close to those of buffered fet logic (bfl), in which all logic functions are performed with active dmesfet elements, but at much lower power levels (pi) = 200-2000 p w/gate), promoting chips of much higher complexity. sdfl does, however, require a more sophisticated fabrication approach in order to optimize both diodes and fets. two independent studies, by the rockwell international science center and the ibm thomas j. watson research center, projected just what the speed advantage would be if lsi circuits were fabricated from gaas instead of silicon, using mesfets. the research was tackled differently by each: ibm used computer simulations for its projections, while rockwell based its projections on actual device measurements. however, both arrived at essentially the same result: all things being equal, gaas mesfet lsi circuits exhibit a sixfold speed advantage over silicon mesfet circuits for the same power- delay product; gaas circuits exhibit a 25 to 40 times lower power dissipation than silicon for the same t d; and gaas ics operate at up to 200°c without changes in ta a or pd. gate delays and power-delay products of the gaas enhancement- mode mesfets are orders of magnitude better than those of today\\'s si n-channel mosfets, where the gaas devices are formed with gate widths of 1 pm and less. one company very active in gaas lsi research, rockwell international, expects gate delays of 60 ps and power-delay products of 35 fj in its 1 p m mesfet technology for logic swings of one volt. the rockwell program has the aggressive goal of putting at least 1000 gates on a gaas substrate within the year, and integration densities will most certainly not stop there. they have fabricated and tested, among other things, a 24-gate, 3- stage binary ripple counter (i.e., divide by eight) implemented with t(toggle)-connected d flip-flops. power dissipation per gate for msi circuits such as this have been running in the few-milliwatts range. the first divide-by-two stage of the counter has been operated at a clock frequency of 1 to 2 ghz, implying gate switching times of approximately 100 ps. the few-milliwatts power dissipations yield p dtd products of a few hundred fj/gate, which is much lower than that achieved with somewhat faster bfl. in the second quarter of 1980, rockwell\\'s dual 32-bit shift register, containing 532 gates, should be available. the rockwell international thousand oaks lab (ca) has reported a 75-gate 3x3 parallel multiplier exhibiting a 172 ps gate delay. 100 f\", \\'operating at a gate dissipation of 570 n w leads to a speed power product of 128 fj; reducing the power to 420 µ w/gate, a gate delay of 225 ps results (and a 94 fj speed-power product). these results were extrapolated to a 1000-gate 8x8 multiplier with a 6 ns multiply time -- dropping to 2 ns with further layout improvements, at a total power consumption of about 300 mw. they hope to demonstrate the 8ic8 multiplier within the year (1980). rockwell believes that 10 4 gate densities may be achieved by about 1983. a philips research lab in france has recently reported a bfl divide-by-two scaler working at 4.4 ghz, and a complementary clock generator working at 5 ghz. in assessing the performance results achieved by gaas ics relative to current silicon devices, it shonid be remembered that the gaas devices fabricated to date use 1m m or less geometries. this leads some to ascribe the outstanding gaas performance results more to the 1 n m geometries and semi-insulating substrates (similar to sos parasitic capacitance reduction for silicon cmos) than to any superior gaas electronic properties and fet characteristics, regardless of the rockwell/ibm studies. although the dmesfet -based sdfi, structure presently enjoys wide application, it by no means forms the complete gaas picture. there are a number of gaas devices, all n-channel fets, since the low hole mobility of gaas precludes the use of p-channel or bipolar devices, and even a complementary logic approach similar to cmos in silicon does not appear promising. the depletion-mode schottky barrier fet (dmesfet) is the most widely used gaas device, and also the one that has given the highest performance to-date. circuits employing dmesfets pose the fewest fabrication problems, but necessarily require two power supplies. the logic gates must contain some form of voltage level shifting which imposes some penalty in terms of wafer area utilization. the er,nancement-mode gaas fet (emesfet) offers circuit simplicity because the logic gates require only one power supply, but the permissible voltage swings are rather low because the schottky b::rier gates on gaas cannot be forward biased above 0.6- 0.8 v without drawing excessive currents. although a half-volt swing is quite reasonable for the operating range of fast, ultra-low power circuits, very tight control is required in order to fabricate uniform, very thin active layers that are totally depleted at zero gate bias and vet give good device transconductance when the device is turned on. 101\\', \"larger gate voltages can be handled by substituting a pn- junction for the metal-semiconductor (schottky) junction to form a junction gate fet (jfet). the larger built-in voltage of the pn- junction allows the gaas jfet to be biased up to vgs ^1 v without excessive conduction. fabrication, however, presents a more difficult processing problem and thus gaas development for jfets is at a less well-developed stage than for mesfets. a sate voltage even larger than the jfet\\'s can be obtained by making the gate from a p-type semiconductor with a band gap larger than gaas, forming a heterojunction gate fet (hjfet). with the p-type ga 0.5 al 0.5 as alloy, the resulting hjfet can be biased up to v gs — 1.4 v without drawing significant current. again, processing poses a difficult problem. implementation of a misfet or even mosfet technology in gaas would eliminate the logic swing limitation completely. so far, however, attaining such devices has proven quite difficult; the japanese are still vigorously pursuing this goal. gaas technology trade-offs are listed in table 3-4. using the gaas devices described above, three major gaas logic circuit families have evolved. buffered fet logic (bfl) is the oldest, fastest and most power hungry. direct-coupled fet logic (dcfl) dissipates the lowest power but also exhibits the slowest speed. lastly, schottky-diode fet logic (sdfl) steers a middle course between the previous two approaches but still achieves the lowest speed-power product. gaas logic family performance results (operated in cascaded- gate ring oscillator fashion) are listed in tab\\' , ^-5. a recent advance in gaas materials research by the office of naval research (onr) may have identified both the cause and the cure for some performance and reliability problems in gaas devices. the mechanical instability of impurity ions in the abrupt dopant gradients necessary for high gains at high frequercies have been traced to induced strain fields in the gaas die which enhance the mobility of dopant impurities so that they more easily diffuse from the surface into the bulk material, thereby altering the intended dopant profile. the suggested cure is to dope the gaas with impurities that cluster into aggregates too large to migrate through the lattice. one manufacturer has already applied this onr research to building devices with the steep inpurity gradients necessary for t-band frequency operation. 102 n ^,\", \\'table 3-4 trade-off between gaas ic technologies active circuit ic can be potential fet device modecomplexity

of applications, is the char.-e-coupled device (ccd), which is an example of a still broader class of structures called charge-transfer devices. these are dynamic devices in which packets of charge are moved in shift register fashion along a closed path under the control of phase-staggered clock pulses. the major portion of the charge packet transfer path consists of a periodic linear array of mos capacitors. depending on whether a bi- or tri-phase clocking scheme is used, every second or third mos capacitor \"gate\" electrode is connected to one of two or three common clocking pulse lines. basic to the operation of the ccd is the dynamic storage and withdrawal of charge in a series of mos capacitors. when a large positive pulse is applied to an mos gate on a p-type substrate, a depletion region is created beneath the gate electrode, accompanied by a considerable increase in the surface potential under the gate. thus, the surface potential \"depression\" forms a potential well which can serve as a container for stored charges. if a constant positive gate bias is applied for a sufficiently long time, electrons thermally generated near the substrate surface will accumulate at the surface, forming a steady-state inversion layer. the amount of inversion charge accumulated is a measure of the capacity of the well for storing charge, and the time to fill the well is called the thermal relaxation time, which depends on the quality of the semiconductor material and its interface with the oxide insulator. for good (negligible charge loss) ccd operation, material quality should be high enough that the thermal relaxation time is much longer than any (non-regenerated) storage time interval. the thermally generated \"noise\" charge is augmented by other noise charge diffusing into the depletion layer from the remaining undepleted substrate. in contrast to the noise charges, \"signal\" charges can enter the ccd depletion layer by •\\\\tdrii\\\\\\'ing from an adjacent part of the depletion layer (i.e., normal ccd charge transfer process); •\\\\tcharge packet injection from a forward biased pn-junction; 104 it\\', \\'e\\\\tphoton absorption in the depletion layer, producing electron-hole pairs. in a p-channel substrate, holes would rapidly leave the depletion region and the electrons would remain in the potential well (the basis of the ccd television camera). in normal ccd operation the mos capacitor gate electrodes receive a pulsed (rather than a steady) positive bias which creates a deep potential well witn instantaneous depletion width much wider than the (thermally generated inversion) equilibrium value. electrons injected into this well, whether electrically or optically, will be stored there until two or three of the bi- or tri-phase clock pulses successively shift the potential well to the next mos capacitor, convecting the stored charge along with it, with, hopefully, very little loss of charge. after traversing all the mos capacitors in a given storage block, a charge packet will have suffered a small fractional charge loss. a charge-sensitive amplifier at the output end of the storage block effectively makes up the charge loss and can reinject the regenerated charge packet into the input of the storage block. such ccds have proven useful in a variety of applications including analog signal processing functions such as signal delay, general filtering (bandpass, transveral and matched) and convolution; chirp z-transform implementation; spread spectrum pulse compression; both optical and (infra red (ir) electronic imaging cameras; and line or block (vs. single word) digital memories. in this last category, however, despite their higher data storage capacity (e.g., 16 and 64 kbits) and speed (relative to moving magnetic media storage), ccds have not outdistanced the dynamic ram far enough in cost, capacity, or availability to succeed to any great extent. another pessimistic aspect in this regard is the susceptibility of ccds to naturally occurring alpha particle radiation, which exceeds even that of dynamic rams. still further threat to its success as a digital memory device comes from its storage volatility and the rapid development of the high-density non-volatile magnetic bubble memory. intel, national, motorola and others have already ceased ccd digital memory efforts and remaining ccd suppliers such as ti and fairchild apparently are not soliciting new application areas. a typical 64-kbit ccd memory has a 410 ps average access time, 5 mb/s maximum data transfer rate, and dissipates 260 mw actively and 26 mw on standby. however, ibm, siemens, and hitachi report 256-kbit ccd memories in research and development. at present, most ccd development has been performed with silicon which is available with the high quality necessary to keep 105\\', \"charge loss (noise) below acceptable levels. now that high quality gaas is becoming available, much faster gaas ccds should be appearing before long. already rockwell international\\'s thousand oaks research center has succeeded in fabricating a 259-gate buried- channel schottley-barrier-gate gaas ccd with charge transfer efficiency of better than 0.999. a smaller, 131-gate version with similar high transfer efficiency, has been operated at speeds up to 500 mhz. their calculations indicate that the 259-gate version should be able to operate at up to 2.5 ghz. surface acoustic wave (saw) devices in addition to the more familiar purely longitudinal (compressional) and purely transverse (shear) modes of planar pressure (acoustic) waves that can traverse the bulk of a solid material, there also exist certain combinations of these modes, called rayleigh (surface) waves, which propagate along (i.e., parallel to) an open planar surface of the solid material. similar to the particles of a surface water wave, particles of the solid material execute elliptical trajectories (in the plane of the surface normal and the wave propagation direction) when a continuous train of surface waves passes by. the size of the elliptical trajectories diminishes exponentially with depth into the solid material, with negligible elliptical motions much deeper than one or two wavelengths. all of the planar surface wave power moves parallel to the surface (and not perpendicularly into the medium) so that the surface waves propagate without spreading loss. the velocity of propagation of these surface acoustic waves can be shown to depend directly on the material constants (e.g., the young\\'s modulus and poisson ratio) alone and not on the frequency. thus, to the extent that the material constants are themselves independent of frequency (up to a few thousand ghz, at least), so also, then. is the velocity of propagation, and surface acoustic waves accordingly propagate without dispersion. the wave propagation velocity is about 85-95% (depending upon the material poisson ratio) of the bulk shear velocity and is typically of the orler of a few millimeters per microsecond. at these velocities, a 30 mhz surface acoustic wave would have a wavelength of about 0.1 mm. one practical use for such surface acoustic waves that might first spring to mind would be a non-dispersive delay line. a 10 /is delay would require only about 2 or 3 cm of wave propagation path in `\\\\t \\\\t dramatic contrast with the equivalent six or seven thousand feet of coaxial cable. 106 !3 0\", \\'all that would be needed would be a thin-line source at one end, to generate planar surface acoustic waves, and a thin-line acoustic wave detector at the other end. this can be realized by plating a pair of very thin and closely spaced metallic lines on either end of the flat surface of a piezoelectric crystal (a type of crystal which develops an internal electric field when mechanically stressed and vice versa). typical crystals used are quartz, lithium niobate and lithium tanl;alate. the electrical impulse response of such a device can be estimated as follows. the spatial extent of the momentary pressure or stress distribution produced by a voltage impulse on the parallel metal strips is approximately as wide as the center-to-center strip spacing and just as long. normally, half of the energy of the stressed region propagates away (at the surface acoustic wave velocity) toward the parallel detector strips at the other end and the other half in the opposite direction into an acoustic absorber, lest an edge-reflected \"echo\" follow the first half to the detector end. more advanced pressure-pulse transducer designs can generate unidirectional acoustic waves using principles akin to those of phased array antennas. in any event, the acoustic wave pulse, generated by an extremely short electrical pulse (impulse), has a finite-width, the inter-strip spacing. accordingly, then, it would generate at the detector a finite width voltage response pulse (even with extremely thin and closely spaced detector strips) as the finite-width acoustic pulse passes under the detector strips while moving at the acoustic wave velocity. with detector strip geometry the same as that of the generator strips, the output voltage pulse time profile (due to a voltage impulse input) is effectively the convolutional \"square\" of the acoustic pulse spatial profile. \\\\tthe impulse response time waveform has a triangular to gaussian shape with full width at half maximum (fwhm) of about the inter-strip spacing divided by the acoustic wave velocity. with current lithographic limits of about 1/im resolution, an impulse response with fwhm of about 1/3 ns results. if the impulse response is approximately gaussian in shape, then the 3 db upper frequency cutoff is given by 0.312/fwhm or about 1 ghz. since almost any number of intermediate detector strip-pairs can be placed between the wave-generating and final detector strip- pairs, multiply-tapped delay lines are easily implemented. if the lengths of a detector strip-pair are shortened, so that their overlap is reduced and accordingly does not intercept the full wavefront of the passing acoustic wave, then a reduced electrical output results. using this technique, called apodization, to weight 107\\', \\'the various outputs of the tapped delay-line intermediate detector strip-pairs, transversal filters can be easily implemented. the implementation of the transversal filter gave rise to a detector array of equally-spaced, interdigitated strips with variable lengths. such an array is often called an interdigital transducer (idt). idts can also have variable strip spacing but equal strip lengths or, in general, variable spacing and lengths. thus, for example, if a many-strip idt acoustic wave generator were fabricated such that in the direction going from the generator to the output detector, the idt strip spacing and overlap both decreased linearly, then a voltage impulse to such an idt array would result in a response function (from a very thin and closely spaced detector strip-pair) which was a chirp signal with linearly decreasing frequency and linearly increasing envelope. quite generally, then, an electrical impulse to an idt array causes an acoustic wave, with the same spatial profile as the idt array, to propagate towards the output detector. the time profile of the resulting impulse response is the same as the spatial profile of the acoustic wave incident on the detector strip-pair. accordingly, the frequency response of the saw device is just the fourier transform of the idt spatial profile function. conversely, to implement a given frequency response, the corresponding impulse response time function is obtained by inverse fourier transforming the given transfer function and then designing the idt apodization profile to follow (spatially) the time profile of the impulse response. actual saw device designs, although based on the above, are complicated by many technical details and second order effects that make the difference between modest and superb performance. saw devices have made a substantial impact on wideband signal processing in areas such as the following: •\\\\tdelay lines: fixed and tapped (typically 0.2 - 10.0 u s) •\\\\tbandpass filters: 60 db stop band rejection, o.ldb pass band ripple; 0.2 - 50 1. fractional bandwidth; 1.1 shape factor (i.e., 3 db to stopband frequency difference) •\\\\tmatched filters •\\\\tfixed: via idt apodization pattern •\\\\tprogrammable: controlled gain at each tap of tapped delay line •\\\\thigh-0 resonators: e.g., qs —20.000 at 150 `hz 108 e. 3 0\\', \\'•\\\\tultra-narrowbant; filters: e.g., 70 khz 3 db bandwidth for 70 mhz center frequency; 40 db stopband rejection. •\\\\tghz \"crystal\" oscillators, working at fundamental frequency; high spectral purity pulse compression: reflective array compressors •\\\\tspread spectrum: eorrelators and synchronizers •\\\\tfourier transform signal processing via chirp-transform technique: e.g., as spectrum emerges from saw device (spectral frequency changing linearly with time), the undesirable spectral regions can be gated out at the times when they emerge, and the \"filtered\" result i!:put to another, inverse-fourier-transforming saw del—ce. saw devices have a number of good characteristics in their favor: •\\\\tsmall size and weight •\\\\tease of fabrication (after design and photolithography phase) •\\\\thigh reproducibility •\\\\tno tuning or readjustment required •\\\\tlong-term stability •\\\\thigh reliability and ruggedness •\\\\tthermal stability •\\\\tlinear phase characteristics •\\\\tindependent magnitude and phase design flexibility: being a transversal filter rather than minimum-phase-shift device saw devices do, however, have some shortcomings: perhaps the most important one being price, if the specific device is not already offered commercially. prototyping saw components, as with any ic, is quite expensive. the non-recurring engineering charges required to design a high resolution photomask can run as .sigh as $20,000 and more. once done, actual device costs are low, e.g., about $1 (in huge quantities) for a t%\\\\\\'-set lc-filter replacement. 109 0 la\\', \\'another saw-device disadvantage is insertion loss (is-20 d8 is not uncommon.) in hopes of integrating high-frequency subsystems on a single chip, consideration is being given to building saw devices an gaas substrates. united technologies research center (east hartford, ct) is building saw delay lines, filter- end resonators on gaas substrates for operation in the 100 ?jo mhz range, with hopes of eventually pushing the operational frequency to 1 ghz. they are also using gaas substrates for voltage -tunable oscillator circuits with saw elements (under a u.s. army erdc contract) and for transversal filters (under a usaf radc contract.) magnetic bubble memories (mbm) a magnetic bubble memory is basically an assembly of long, ind- around-connected shift register arrays implemented on a thin magnetic film epitaxially deposited on a substrate crystal. the logical ones and zeros are represented by the presence or absence of magnetic \"bubbles\". a ferromagnetic single crystal garnet is grown on a gadolinium - gallium-garnet (g ) substrate in such a fashion that the direction of easy magnetization is normal to the thin magnetic film. the spontaneous magnetization of the isrromagnetic film assumes the form of intertwined serpentine domains as a result of a balance struck between several magnetic energy factors. if the magnetic film were to be uniformly polarized -- one surface with all n-polarization, the other with all s-polarization -- there would be a substantial exterior fringe b-field of flux lines leaving one surface, looping around the film edges, and reentering the other surface. if the surface were polarized in checks-board fashion -- some squares n-polarized, adjacent ones s-polarized -- the fringing b-fields would be confined mainly to the checker-square boundaries. since there is stored energy in magnetic fields, the second configuration would have the smaller stored energy and thus be energetically more favorable. proceeding with this logic, however, it would seem that the lowest energy (xnd thus physically occurring) state would be one in which the polar;4;:tion of individual atoms alternated, and no macroscopic (ferro) magnetism would be observed -- contrary to fact. actually, in the crystalline state, electrons interact through both electric (coulomb interaction) and magnetic (electron spin-spin interaction) terms. the direct magnetic term turns out to be quite small, and it is the coulomb interaction, in conjunction with the pauli exclusion principle, which determines whether the ground state 110 v4 4\\', \\'will consist of parallel electron spins (ferromagnetic czae) or antiparallea spins (antiferromagnatic case). in a few elements and compounds -- the ferromagnetic materials -- the lowest energy state is one of parallel electron spins. as a result, if two adjacent electron spins were to be at nn angle, one should expect there to arise a \"counter torque\" (the heisenberg exchange force) tending to return the spins to the minimum energy state of parallel spins. quantum mechanics shows the interaction to be proportional to the vectorial scalar product of the two electron spin vectors -- i.e., proportional to the cosine of the angle between the spin vectors. thus, in the macroscopic picture, where small, alternating- polarity domains are energetically favorable, one might also expect a transition region (bloch wall) between opposite polarity domains, in which successive electron spins would be progressively rotated, thereby making a smooth transition from the characteristic direction of one domain to the opposite direction of the adjacent domain. militating against such an extended, smooth transition, however, is the fact that electron spins with components perpendicular to the surface normal (direction of easy magnetization) have higher energies (energy of magnetocrystalline anisotropy) than those parallel to the surface normal. thus, widenins the bloch wall diminishes the heisenberg exchange energy but thereby increases the wagnetic anisotropy energy, and vice versa for narrowing the bloch wall. since the bloch wall energy ultimately increases, whether the wall gets smaller or larger, there is some intermediate wall thickness which yields a minimum wall energy. one final balance is struck between being all bloch wall with no appreciable domain area (exchange and anisotropy energy dominated) and being one large domain with no need for bloch walls (magnetic fringe-field energy dominated). this sets the average domain size, and it turns out that thin, elongated, intertwined strip regions of opposite polarity satisfy the two key requirements: •\\\\tno domain areas are very far from one of opposite polarity •\\\\tdomain areas and bloch wall areas are comparable. if the magnetic film is initially unmagnetized, half of the serpentine strip domains will have one polarization and half the other. if a uniform external magnetic field (bias field) is applied i,ormal to the magnetic film, some of the electron spins opposite the applied field direction will be forced into alignment with the field. the result is to enlarge the domains with spires parallel to the applied field at the expense of those with antiparallel spins. 111 0\\', \\'as the external field is increased, the lengths of the antiparallel strip domains decrease and ultimately become comparable to their widths, at which point they assume circular boundaries due to \"surface tension\" of the bloch walls. these circular cylinders of minority polarization, adrift in a sea of majority polarization, are called magnetic bubbles. if the external magnetic field strength is increased still further, the electron spins in the magnetic bubbles finally become all field aligned (i.e., the bubble shrinks into oblivion) and the film becomes completely uniformly magnetized. thus, by maintaining an external magnetic bias field normal to the magnetic thin film and within certain intensity margins, magnetic bubble domains can be made to exist within the magnetic film. currently available magnetic bubble memory devices have 2-3 1i m diameter bubbles and l pm bubble devices are not far off. from basic materials and magnetic properties, however, it would seem that the prospects of further significant reduction in bubble size are fairly slim. to make a practical memory employing magnetic bubbles, one must be able both to confine them to fixed locations and access them there as well as to create and destroy them. storage locations (bubble rest sites) are currently defined by depositing on top of the thin magnetic film, long closed-path storage loops (propagation patterns) consisting of small, closely-spaced and specifically- shaped patches (chevrons) of soft ferromagnetic (permalloy) material. the magnetic bubble domains, like little bar magnets, are attracted to these soft magnetic chevrons and, without further influence, stay closely attached. since magnetic bubbles (again, like little bar magnets) repel one another, they must be kept 4 or s diameters apart. otherwise, if two or more adjacent magnetic bubbles in a loop happen to be next to three or more empty bubble sites, the end bubble ccild be pushed off its present site onto an empty site, thereby changing the data pattern of ones and zeros. thus, with 8-1011m spacing between 2 pm magnetic bubbles, one million bubbles could be stored on a chip (substrate with deposited thin magnetic film) of 1 cm 2or less. accessing storage locations on a storage loop is achieved by rotating the loop data (pattern of absent and present magnetic bubbles) until the content of a specific storage location is opposite a special detection point. rotation of the storage loop data is accomplished by applying a rotating magnetic field (field access approach) which is tangential to the magnetic film surface (and thus perpendicular to the magnetic bias field that sustains the magnetic bubble domains). each complete rotation of the tangential magnetic field induces a magnetic bubble to transfer from one chevron to the next. the rotating field is presently produced byi 112 f\\', \\'phased excitation of two orthogonally oriented coils wound around the bubble memory chip. currently, field rotation rates are limited to 100-200 khz, without, for various technical reasons, much hope for significant increase. since the maximum chevron-to-chevron magnetic bubble domain transfer rate is determined by the me..anum rotating magnetic field rate, and data transfer rates are d; ectly related to bubble domain transfer rates, significant increases in data transfer rates are not very likely using the field access approach. the presence or absence of a magnetic bubble domain is at present most often detected (read) with a magnetoresistive loop whose resistance changes momentarily as the magnetic field of the bubble domain passes by. similarly to the read operation (detection of magnetic bubble domains), the write operation (creation or annihilation of bubbles) also takes place at a specific writing location from which the results are brought to storage locations by loop rotation. two main techniques of bubble creation are direct production and seed replication. direct production induces magnetic polarization reversal in a small area of majority-polarized material by means of a pulsed current loop. seed replication causes an ever-present magnetic bubble domain (seed) to elongate and then split into two bubble domains, one of which remains behind as the seed. commercially available magnetic bubble memories exhibit several loop architectures. if storage size is not too great, one single loop may suffice. but with 100 khz field rotation rates, the fujitsu 74 kbit memory requires 0.74 second for a complete loop rotation, so that the average storage location access time is about 370 msec. for larger memories, and for speed in general, multiple- loop architectures are employed. for instance, a widely used texas instruments magnetic bubble memory of 92 kbit capacity has 144 a41-bit long storage loops (actually 157, but for production yield purposes, up to 13 (redundancy) loops are allowed to be somehow deficient). to avoid having to hak!v 144 magnetic bubble detectors and generators, a major-minor loop architecture is employed. the 144 (minor) loops each have a transfer point by which a 144-bubble parallel transfer to or from another (major) loop can take place. thus, only a single detector and generator is needed to operate on the major loop contents. since transfer of minor loop contents to the major loop constitutes destructive readout of the storage (minor) loops, two complete storage: loop rotations are necessary for nondestructive readout: one to fetch (to the major loop) the bubble data from storage locations on the minor loops for reading, and a second to return the read bubble data (from the major loop) to their original positions on the storage (minor) loops. even with this somewhat awkward procedure, the average access time is reduced to 4 ms. 113\\', \\'to simplify procedures and further decrease access times, block replicate architecture supplants major-minor loop architecture. each storage (minor) loop now has two exchange points (swap gates), one at each end. also, at each end of the loop arrays there are half-major-loops (access rails) to or from which minor loop parallel excl inges or replications can take place. thus, to write data into memory, data is serially written onto the input rail and parallel exchanged with appropriately positioned minor loop data. to read data from memory, minor loop data is rotated into replicate gate position and replicated onto the output rail which is serially read by the magnetoresistive bubble detector. a texas instruments 0.5 mbit magnetic bubble memory, with 256 data (300 actual) 2049-bit loops, achieves an 11.2 ms average access time with a 100 khz field rotation rate. an operating magnetic bubble memory system consists of much more than a thin magnetic film on a chip. the access drive coils and bubble generator loop require shaping and drive amplifiers; the bubble domain detector requires a very sensitive sense amplifier; a very complicated controller is required to tend to the myriad of bookkeeping and timing details necessary to interface standard computer data-bus signals with the serial requirements of the bubble memory. in addition, most large (e.g. >_ 0.5 mb) memory systems provide error correction coding (ecc) capability. this both complicates the controller system and increases the number of non- data (e.g., redundancy) storage loops (for storing the ecc bits). thus, when considering the power consumption of complete magnetic bubble memor y systems, one is really comparing the consumption of the various peripheral controller systems. the same controller system, however, can control multiple magnetic bubble memory chips. for instance, eight 1-mb memory chips can be combined by one controller to form an 8 mbyte memory. designers are studying several areas that might allow boosting magnetic bubble memory chip capacities into the range of 4 to 16 mb, ultimately, perhaps, to 200-300 mb. some of these areas are: •\\\\tscaling down conventional device designs limited by available lithographic resolution; magnetic bubbles must still be kept 4-5 diameters apart. •\\\\twall-encoded lattice devices: the bloch wall encircling the magnetic bubble domain can be given several distinguishable structural features; allows packing with only 2 magnetic bubble diameter spacing. 114\\', \"•\\\\tcontiguous disc propagation paths: no gaps in magnetic chevrons; created by ion implantation into the magnetic garnet film; allows magnetic bubble domain diameters to be smaller than the minimum lithographic features. •\\\\tcurrent access methods: access fields produced by current- carrying layers deposited above the magnetic film, rather than by slower conventional orthogonally oriented coils; this technology promises 10 to 20 times higher clock speeds -- from 1 to perhaps 20 mhz -- than in present systems. parameters of some of the currently available magnetic bubble memory chips are given in table 3-6. 3.9.3.2 lsi technologies with near-term promise an lsi technology with near-term promise will be considered here as one which, by approximately the middle of the 1980\\'s, is the result of either conservatively projected advances (based on past. growth performance) in a currently progressive technology, or of a well-demonstrated laboratory device technology close to being introduced commercially. some examples of such technologies to be considered are vlsi in general, cmos and cmos/sos, gaas at the lsi level, transferred electron logic devices ane- josephson junctions at the msi level. very large scale integration (vlsi) very large scale integration is not well-defined, but it is commonly agreed that several hundred thousand to a million gates per chip is the rough area. designers, questioning how far miniaturization could be pushed, fairly well agree that physical laws draw the line at a gate length near 0.2 n m, since below this point intense electric fields would cause electrical breakdown in dielectrics. random access memories have so far been the proving ground for vlsi and, true to form, the minimum geometries now in production are 2-3p m (typified by texas instruments\\' 64 kb dynamic ram and intel\\'s 16 kb static ram). channel lengths of 3-5 1i m are common in the high-speed logic circuits of microprocessors. minimum geometries of 0.5 - 1.0 pm are projected for the mid-1980\\'s. ?\\\\t \\\\t one rather drastic shot in the arm for vls\\' technology advancement is afforded by the very high-speed integrated circuits (vhsic) program of the department of defense (dod). the vhsic program will spend more than $200 million over six years to develop 115 i 0\", \"table 3-6 commercially available magnetic bubble memory chips deviceminor loops

and be smaller and more reliable than current integrated circuits would allow. the goal of this program is pilot production in 1986 of processors containing 250,000 gates, operating at clock speeds of at least 25 mhz, and performing several million to several billion operations per second. the gates would be fabricated with silicon (being a much more mature technology than gaas) mos or bipolar technology and have minimum dimensions of 0.5 - 0.8 1i m. the required speed and circuit density would be obtained both by scaling down current lsi circuits -- proportionately reducing such basic parameters as channel length, oxide thickness and supply voltage -- and by developing new types of system architecture. table 3-7 gives both current capabilities and mid-1980\\'s vhsic program goals and figure 3 -21 znmpares vhsic chip lithography goals with some current capabilities (3 /i m design rules). table 3-8 gives similar commercial mid-1980\\'s goals. table 3-9 gives an idea of the relative promise of the various logic family technologies for achieving vlsi. figures 3-22 and 3-23 show the yearly trend in lsi chip density increase and assumes comparable advances will continue. since technology advancements in memories simultaneously improve both access time and density, the yearly improvement in access time is shown only for one of the earliest available sizes (1 kb) of mos ram in figure 3-24. in figure 3-25 a similar plot is given for bipolar rams of several sizes with estimated extrapolations in access time and size. cmos and cmos/sos several manufacturers have announced plans to strengthen their cmos designs by reducing capacitance and aiming for speed rivaling that of bipolar technology, while simultaneously minimizing increases in power consumption. cmos with a 511m gate length now exhibits a gate delay of 1.8 ns and a power-delay product of 6 pj. the mitel corporation (ottawa, canada) is scaling their next generation cmos down to 4 pm to operate with a 3 ns gate delay and power product of less than 0.2 pj.\\\\tfurther scaling to 211m  is expected to yield 1 ns gate delays with a 0.1 pj power-delay product. at present mitel isolates all n- and p-type devices with oxide to boost speed. american microsystems, inc., (ami) is scaling their next generation cmos to 3.511m and expects to break the 1 ns barrier in gate delay. the company is

recently announced a 16-bit (10,oov gate) cmos microprocessor that dissipates just 130 mw (13g w/gate) when operated at 2.5 mhz. the central processing unit (cpu) can address up to 16 mbytes and has a 400 ns machine cycle. national semiconductor has introduced an 8-bit cmos microprocessor which combines the bus structure of the •ntel 8085 with the instructions and dynamic memory refresh capat.\\'_ity of the zilog z80. operating at the full z80 clock rate of 4 mhz ti;s microprocessor consumes just 125 mw. hitachi has announced a cmos equivalent to the (industry standard 4 kb ram) intel 2147. capable of being accessed in 55 ns, the hitachi device consumes just 75 mw (19 p w/bit) in the active state and only 4 #w in standby (vs. the mos 2147: 9co mw active and 150 mw in standby). they have also announced a 16 kb static cmos ram with 75 ns access time which dissipates 200 mw (12.5u w/bit) when active and 25µ w in standby. by way of comparison, it should be mentioned that ibm has described a 16 kb static i 2l ram with 45 ns access time and 120 mw power dissipation (7.5# w/bit). still substantially more expensive than normal cmos, cmos/sos has yet to fulfill its promise. rca is currently using cmos/sos for a 4 kb memory and is planning to use the sos capability on its forthcoming cdp-1804 single-chip microcomputer. rockwell international has experimented with cmos/sos and has developed three high-performance circuits for evaluation. one is a 12-bit analog-to-digital converter that operates in 2.5/is; the second is a frequency synthesizer c4,able of operating at 160 mhz while consuming less than 25 mw; and the third is a viterbi decoder that can pass a 127-bit pseudocode pattern when operating at 70 mb/- and consuming only 40 mw. these circuits are fabricated using 3-4 pm channel lengths, which in turn yields average propagation delays of 1-2 ns and 600 fj speed-power products. future projections include channel length reductions to 1-2 gm, speed-power products dropping to 200 fj, propagation delays cut to 200 ps, and packing densities of less than 1 square mil per transistor. table 3-10 gives some late-1980\\'s projections for cmos/sos

boost afforded silicon vlsi development by the dod vhsic program. the difficulties in gaas ic technology are substantial. the materials technology itself is relatively immature, and flexibility in controlling all device and material properties is limited. the need to dc fine and control some device dimensions with submicron accuracy limits the processing approaches that can be used. in particular, lack of a good native oxide for gaas eliminates many of the self-aligned processes that are used to make short-channel silicon mosfets. even the many logic approaches available have not been fully explored, so that efforts could be concentrated on just one or two of the most promising avenues. nevertheless, a number of gaas ic demonstration circuits have been designed and built. rockwell international has led the way, producing such circuits as a 64-gate 8:1 data multiplexer, a 75-gate 3x3 parallel multiplier ( 2 ns, 50 mw), a 96-gate 217-bit pseudorandom noise code generator. a 260-gate 5x5 parallel multiplier ( 4 ns, 150 mw), a 550-gate dual 4.3 x 10 9 bit pseudorandom noise code generator and a 1000-gate 8x8 parallel multiplier ( 6 ns and 300 mw). by 1984, dr. r. l. eden of rockwell believes circuits with complexities approaching 10,000 gates will be feasible on a chip just 5 mm on a side. in comparison, today\\'s microprocessors with about 10,000 gates require a chip about 7.5 mm on a side, or about 2.3 times more area. he further projects that propagation delays will be reduced to about 50 ps with 1 1i m mesfet gate structures and further reductions to 20 ps will be possible with 0.25 - 0.50/im gates. cryogenic operation at liquid nitrogen temperatures (77°h) would ultimately reduce delays to 10 ps. transferred electron logic devices (teld transferred electron logic devices are effectively gunn diodes with an additional schottky-barrier gate terminal. many iii-v semiconductors such as gaas have conduction band structures with two minima. one band minimum is lower (1.43 ev gap) at zero momentum (k = 0) with high k-space curvature (low effective mass: mj = 0.07 me) and the other band\\'s shallower minimum is 0.3 ev higher at some non-zero momentum and has a higher effective mass: 11413 0\", \"m2* = 1.2 me =17 m i*. if an electron in the first band (with effective mass m l*) is accelerated by an electric field to the point where it has gained the intraband energy difference of 0.3 ev, it can transfer to the second band where it has the much larger effective mass w. since no (kinetic) energy has been lost in transferring between bands, the electron\\'s velocity must be less due to the increased effective mass, this sudden decrease in velocity due to an increasing electric field amounts to a negative mobility, p, at that particular energy. further increase in the electric field causes further increase (although more slowly) in the electron velocity. since the conductivity is o = nett, where n is the density of electrons, and the current density resulting from the applied electric field is j = o e = ne/le, then the decrease in j (as e increases) at the critical energy point, where the mobility drops to the lower value, represents a dynamic negative resistance effect. the two-terminal device with this type of negative resistance region is called a gunn diode and can be made to oscillate at up to 40-50 ghz. fundamentally, the exceedingly high gain-bandwidth product attainable in negative-resistance, transferred electron device operation should offer extremely high logic speeds. due to their relatively high operating power levels and the great difficulty in getting large numbers of critical threshold devices like telds on one chip to have operating voltages close enough to be able to work from the same power supply, telds appear to be unsuitable for vlsi applications. the unique properties of telds can, however, offer exceptional performance in specific applications. for example, a monolithic integrated gaas binary phase shift keyed bpsk modulator was fabricated using only three telds. it handled 1.5 gb/s data on a 5 ghz carrier with a total power dissipation of 235 mw, whereas a si ic implementation (even of inferior performance) contained 175 active devices with a total power dissipation of 850 mw. josephson junction devices - `1si level josephson junction devices are based upon the phenomenon of quantum mechanical tunneling of superconducting currents through a very thin insulating film separating two superconducting layers. the phase of the wave function of the tunneling superconducting electron pairs can be affected by the magnetic field of an adjacent control current and, in turn, the nature of the tunneling current 129 i \", \"itself, whether it remains superconducting with no voltage drop across the junction or not. using such elements, it has been possible to fabricate devices with the basic logical and, or, invert and latch functions that have demonstrated switching times as low as 10 ps which, combined with power outputs of only a few microwatts, yield power-delay products of tens of attojoules (1 aj = 10- 18.1). these low powers do not reflect the power consumed by the cryogenic system maintaining the devices at the near liquid helium temperatures (4 0k) needed for maintaining the superconductive state. ibm has fabricated and tested an experimental memory model for investigating the feasibility of a 16 kb ram with josephson junctions. there were nearly 4500 josephson junctions in the design which included the array, line drivers and address decoders. the storage element was a single flux-quantum cell arranged in a 2 kb array. drivers and decoders were based on the principle of current steering in superconducting loops, which is a medium speed but low power approach. the measured read-access time of the model was approximately 10 ns. power dissipation for a read/write cycle time of 30 ns was about 10yw, whereas it was zero for the unselected chip. results indicated that a 16 kb chip is feasible, and the estimated access time and power dissipation was 15 ns and 40 p w, respectively. 3.9.3.3 lsi technologies wi th far-term promise an lsi technology with far-term promise is considered as one which is much less certain to mature and which might, perhaps in the late 1980\\'s or early 1990\\'s, become generally available. only two were found that were pertinent to the baseband processor: josephson junction technology at an lsi level and the area of integrated optics and optical processing. josephson junction devices - lsi level based on the work done so far, ibm scientists have been able to outline what the first josephson junction computers will look like and be able to do. a range of designs has been put forward from a conservative first-generation machine to designs more representative of the real potential for superconducting electronics. the conservative design involves a mainframe computer fitting into a volume about 10 cm on a side (including cpu, cache memory, and main memory) with a 16-mbyte (128 mb) memory and 70 million instructions/second capacity. less conservative projections, based on capabilities already demonstrated with experimental devices, 130 i;r\", \"foreshadow super computers in a 2.5 cm cube with 64-128 mbyte memories and capacities of a billion instructions/sec. by comparison, the largest ibm computers produced today have 6 mbyte memories, 50-80 ns cycle-times and capacities of 3.5 million instructions/second. integrated optics and optical processing the basic building blocks for an integrated optical circuit have reached a state of development where complete circuits are being attempted. the performance of such basic elements as coherent light sources, optical waveguide components, optical modulators and optical detectors have been demonstrated in the laboratory to be of sufficient merit to initiate serious design efforts of functional subsystems on a chip. one such optical subsystem receiving a great deal of attention is the integrated optic spectrum analyzer (iosa). it consists of an injection laser whose output is conducted through a planar optical wave guide beam expander to a planar luneburg lens which in turn collimates the laser light and uniformly irradiates the acousto- optic bragg cell area. exiting from the bragg cell, the deflected light is refocused by a second planar luneburg lens and directed to a detector array. the bragg cell is driven by a saw interdigital transducer, in turn driven by the signal to be spectrally analyzed. 3.9.4 overview of commonly available state-of-the-art lsi products selected examples of what is felt to be indicative of the state of the art in lsi design and general functional complexity are presented. table 3-11 lists key parameters of four of the major 16- bit microprocessors presently available, of which the ti 9900 is the oldest. table 3-12 lists the speeds of six direct memory access (dma) controller chips which manage fast data transfers to and from the memory without involving any appreciable interaction with the microprocessor cpu. table 3-13 lists six vendors\\' approaches to implementing the nbs 56-bit key data encryption standard. table 3-14 and figure 3-26 present some of the commercially available and due-to-become available parallel multiplier circuits. figure 3-26 also shows the multiplier power demands made by the 10 ns sampling rate of the proposed baseband processor design. figure 3-27 indicates how slower multipliers are pipelined to maintain the sampled data rate. finally, table 3-15 and figure 3-28 show the state of the art, real and proposed, of the analog-to-digital conversion technology. 131 t\", \"derto n n n:l 4;nco q1 .m.r

\\'3.9.5 recommendations since the tabulation of estimated baseband processor device power dissipations indicate that cmos memory would be relied upon heavily, radiation hardening should be looked into. with minimal vehicle shielding, an estimate of some 100 krad/yr at synchronous altitude is assumed, so at least 1 mrad hardness is presumed necessary for a 10 year mission. since the speed and lower power dissipation of gaas was also assumed in much of the processor circuitry power estimates, it is felt that it would be of great value to foster further development in the gaas lsi technology areas of •\\\\tfast parallel multipliers, •\\\\tflash a/d converters, •\\\\tteld modulator and demodulator chips, as well as to look into their radiation damage and hardening situation. more explicit information is available from the general bibliography provided following the appendixes of this report. 140 3\\', \\'3.10 conclusions/recommendations the conclusions and recommendations on the baseband processor are summarized in this section. rough estimates of the number of ic chips and power consumption, presuming continued technological development and several customized circuit. designs, are provided. 3.10.1 baseband processor interfaces in the wider sense adopted in this report, baseband processor interfaces include modulation, demodulation, and traffic parameters. •\\\\tdemodulators the all-digital approach to on-board demodulation is feasible and is recommended pending further investigations of hybrid demodulation using acoustoelectric devices and/or charged transfer devices. the all-digital implementation would be realized either with multipliers or cordic rotators. for equivalent performance each technique consumes in the order of 100 w of power using fast, low power gallium arsenide msi or lsi circuits. a more detailed comparison is necessary to strongly recommend one technique over the other. analysis suggests specific parameters for the all-digital design of the baseline system: (assuming 100 mhz bandwidth and 1 b/cycle modulation; see. appendix c) 8 fdma channels per beam per dwell interval 8 b accumulators multjkl ier a roach s b a/d converters s x s b multipliers (pipelined) cordic rotator approach h\\\\t6 b a/d converters 4 mini-rotations per rotation (pipelined adders) attention should be given to the development of the required gaas components. further consideration and spacecraft qualification of acoustoelectric devices and is recommended (see appendix d). 141 t\\', \\'although microwave if (microstrip) hardware can be employed as a passive and purely analog means of demodulating qpsk, this method is not recommended because it cannot be used with advanced bandwidth and power efficient modulations which utilize a non-rectangular baseband waveform shape. •\\\\tmodulation a constant envelope, 4-ary, or perhaps 8-ary, small modulation index, phase-coded modulation with baseband signaling shape extending over several symbol intervals should be selected for conservation of frequency spectrum and transmitter power. emphasis should be given to discovering good coding schemes to employ as an integral part of the modulation. attention should be devoted to the development of acceptable methods of signal synchronization and maximum likelihood detection. (see appendix e.) •\\\\ttraffic analysis further work is warranted to determine communications traffic statistics and how they can be used to bias the baseband processor controller for more efficient use of satellite capacity. mechanisms for measuring and automatically acting upon departures from the preprogrammed average traffic loads are required. (see appendix a). •\\\\tnon-real-time data packet broadcast, multiple access schemes exist for low duty factor terminals with non-real-time data that make very efficient use of shared satellite channels without centralized control. capacity and delay performance has been analyzed. (see appendix b.) current planning efforts should include means for incorporating such services in future satellite system designs. - 3.10.2 bit processor/packet switch the bit/processor or packet switch is the central portion of the on-board baseband processing activity. a general purpose architecture capable of performing a variety of functions necessary for handling customer premises traffic was postulated. the processor/switch architecture was designed in sufficient detail to permit estimates of the number and type of ic chips required. technology assessments have led to the approximate estimates of prime power consumption listed in table 3-16. it is emphasized that considerable advanced development and custom ic chip design is required to meet these goals. the td`f double buffer appears to be very consumptive of power and therefore may benefit from some specialized implementation technique. the current power estimate is ,1 142 0\\', \\'m 14 a o ow 1 c\" n w o 1- ^ j 11 it it

straightforward design using gaas 100 p w/b hardware not presently attainable. if 1 kw of power for baseband processing is too much to contemplate for the next generation satellite, one could easily reduce the power requirement by simply reducing the bandwidth per beam to 50 mhz from 100 mhz, for example. this should halve the power requirement to about 50ow, using a first-order approximation. alternatively, one might wish to investigate other baseband architectural approaches. a number of recommendations regarding the link establishment and message handling protocols, packet formats, and packet switch design of this section are listed below. •\\\\tprotocols separate (two level) protocols are recommended, one for link establishment and one for message (packet) transmission. these protocols should be verified and related to any standard protocol requirements before implementation. multipoint protocols need further investigation. additional analysis is necessary to establish time-out values. a decision should be made regarding the locaiton of the orderwire processor, i.e., whether it should be on-board and controlled from the ground, or on the ground. although a ground location may be more reliable, an on-board orderwire controller is recommended primarily because of the savings in propagation delay to and from the satellite. orderwire access schemes require further tradeoff analysis. •\\\\tpacket formats further work on the details of packet error control are required, especially in terms of the efficient use of packet overhead bits. •\\\\tpacket switch additional work is recommended to further reduce the chip count through the use of lsi and vlsi to conserve space, power, and connections. the bulk memory architecture, resulting from the high throughput specification of the baseline design, is responsible for one-third the power consumption of the bit/packet processor. this may be another area that could benefit from additional design effort. 144 0\\', \\'although the listed 200 ns speed of the fifo memories is satisfactory these chips might be reduced in size and power. the application of queueing theory should help evaluate delay performance and buffer length requirements. continued assessment of packet versus message versus circuit switching techniques is appropriate to identify the hybrid approach best suited to the customer premises application. 145\\', \"_\\\\t _ section 4 microwave switch the preceding sections have been concerned with baseband processing in a satellite serving a large number of lower data rate (typically single t1 channel) users. the 30/20 ghz program also envisions providing high capacity service for high data rate digital trunking or heavy rate service (typically t3, t4 channels). with extremely high capacities, high data rate demodulation/remodulation may not be feasible. in this class of applications, switching of the undemodulated rf carriers from an uplink beam to a particular downlink beam is envisioned as the method of routing the signals in a multibeam satellite. to accomplish this signal routing, an on-board crossbar switch is needed. conceptually, this switching will occur at an intermediate frequency, but due to the bandwidths used in the contemplated 30/20 ghz system, the frequency will be in the microwave range. consequently, the switching unit is referred to as a crossbar microwave switch. the size of the crossbar (nxn) will ultimately be determined by the multibeam antenna capability, connectivity, and other factors. in the first year\\'s effort, all possible architectures and technologies for such a switch were investigated. a crossbar with directional couplers and field effect transistors (fets) as switches at the crosspoints was selected. it was concluded that a further investigation of a 100 x 100 size would reveal all of the problems which required detailed attention. (a rationale based on population statistics was also presented which suggested that a switch of this size might be useful at some future date.) this section describes a design study of a 100 x 100 crossbar microwave switch which follows up conclusions drawn in the first year\\'s study report.[1,3] the design is physically a microwave crossbar with fet amplifiers as switching elements. early in this study, it was found that a design, even to the level needed to build a working breadboard, was beyond the manpower and resources assigned to this portion of this year\\'s program. to do that adequately might have required the addition of a mechanical engineering team, including drafting, plus augmentation of the electrical engineering team. a minimum of six man years of effort would have been needed. 147 preading pan blank not filmed el i if\", \\'instead, salient areas were studied. key results along with an outline of how to build the switch are presented. present day microwave integrated circuitry based on microstrip transmission lines and discrete microwave devices is employed. these circuits are printed on high dielectric constant materials such as epsilam 10 which reduces wavelengths by a factor of 3. the printed circuit materials are supported by epoxy fiberglass boards because the materials are only 0.025 inch thick. the material and the board are laminated and cut to a convenient size to form cards. then the cards are employed in the card, connector, motherboard, drawer technology prevalent in current electronic equipment design. it is assumed that the printed circuit cards can have appropriate mechanical hardware which will enable them to be mounted in the kind of open framework necessary to accomplish the crossbar interconnections for the switch. the framework will have modules so that it can be assembled a drawer at a time. the drawers will be enclosed by covers which can be easily installed or removed. a conceptual discussion of the framework and card assemblage is given below but its detailed mechanical design is not considered. proven microwave integrated circuit technology is used in the design of the switch. the alternative was to assume the monolithic approach currently being researched for amplifiers and to adopt the predictions of the advocates regarding reductions in size. this could have led to predictions of reduced sizes for the switch which would have been highly speculative. in addition, costs would have been much higher because the entire switch might consist of a large gallium arsenide crystal. most important, the infra structure of products needed to make the switch, such as connectors, circulators, cards, frames, printed circuit laminates, etc., does not exist for monolithic technology. consequently, the best currently proven technology is used to configure the switch. the object of this phase of the study is to provide a benchmark design which will work and against which future advances can be measured. the sizes and weights which result are upper estimates and it is expected that any future design will be an improvement. construction principles can be summarized briefly. the microwave switch will consist of a control logic group and a microwave switching assembly. the control logic group will employ standard logic packiges. both the control logic and the microwave switching assembly will be mounted on cards which will be housed in drawers. these will have the necessary interfaces to the outside world including the master computer on board the satellite, the master satellite clock, and the uplink changes channel from the control station on the ground. 148\\', \\'4.1 microwave switch assembly card organization the microwave switching assembly will be cut into cards and housed in open drawers because of the three-dimensional interconnections required for the switch operation. if this assembly were not cut into cards, it would consist of a multilayer plane at least 8.5 feet tall, 12.5 feet wide, and possibly 6 inches thick, not including mounting support. the sectioned assembly will still perform as if it were a crossbar as suggested by figure 4-1. the uncut crossbar switch includes two parallel layers. the top layer consists of the rows and the bottom consists of the columns. signals enter the switch at the input to a row and proceed along it, passing the columns for which they are not destined. when the signal reaches the intended output column, it encounters a closed switch and is sent out of the row layer via a feed-through to the column layer below. the signal then exits the switch via this column. when cut, the microwave assembly yields two-layer cards. as a first step in cutting the switch up into cards, the switch is divided into groups of adjacent rows. this can be envisaged as cutting the assembly, for example, between rows 10 and 11 and lifting off a strip which contains 10 rows plus the associated parts of the columns in the second layer below. the 10 row strip would be 10 inches high and 150 inches long. it would next be cut into 20 cards providing 1/2-inch clearance for connectors on each edge, resulting in 11 inch x 8.5 inch two-layer cards which could be mounted in drawers. cables would have to be used between cards to maintain the row connectivity. the card interconnection concept along a row is called \"snaking\" after the coiling of a snake and is illustrated in figure 4-2. this shows an input connector to a drawer at the beginning of a 10 row strip. the other nine connectors are directly below it and cannot be seen. each card has two sets of 10 connectors to provide row interconnection between cards. the cards are dual in that a column card is connected to, and just behind, each row card. there remain the connections necessary to connect 10 strips each having 10 rows. this is done by verticalization and is illustrated in figure 4-3. the column layer of the dual card contains edge connectors which enable the columns to be reconnected to full 100 crosspoint height. thus, the concepts of snaking and verticalization provide the topology necessary to connect the full 100 x 100 microwave crosspoint switch. 14-9 k3 0\\', \\'w u qj cl q wru.r n l no lci 1 vl7 la.l l l l\\\\t -1\\\\t1.\\\\t1 \\\\t0 \\\\t 0 cl 2 t3150 0\\', \\'x 00ll oaaycn j 0 j u uw o q v z m w u u >w\\\\t

row/column microwave cards 100 fan out decoder cards • 6,000 miniature coaxial connectors and cables • 5,000 dual flip-flops for level 3 memory • 2,000 connectors for control and direct current the drawers must provide space for cable installation. since the cables approach the dual cards on all four edges, a new mechanical concept is required for a drawer. this concept treats the drawer as an open frame supporting 20 dual cards but open on four sides so that necessary cabling and electrical connections can be made. the frame can be closed with covers afterward. the concept of verticalization also requires an exterior frame so that the drawers may be supported while still interconnected top and bottom by 100 cables. vertical spacing must be provided between the drawers by the exterior frame so that the 100 vertical interdrawer cables can be installed. it is likely that the drawers will not be stacked in one column 10 drawers high. two five drawer stacks would be more convenient. the vertical cables can come out of the top of one stack and can go into the top of the other. 4.2 crosspoint configuration the size of the switch is determined by that of the crosspoint. there are 10,000 crosspoints so every effort must be made to reduce crosspoint area. the crosspoint area presented is conservative. a study both experimental and theoretical is recommended to decrease its size. there is no doubt that this can be accomplished. there is also no doubt that the crosspoint described can be developed and will work. it is based upon the use of dielectric printed circuit material whose dielectric constant is 10 (such as minnesota mining and manufacturing company epsilam 10). the dielectric material is 0.025 inch thick which requires a censer conductor width of 0.044 inch for a characteristic impedance of 50 ohms. the crosspoint shown ir ► figure 4-4 is part of a row board. it consists of a main line microstrip conductor which ultimately passes all 100 crosspoints in a row, a wiggly line directional coupler 153 w\\', \"if1rw c ^oa nn0lu \\'olr0 vl7 ll ja h m q o r0 0 o^ 0 154\", \"which couples over a very broad frequency band, a three-stage fet amplifier used as a switch, a small matched load for the coupler, a feed-through to the column board below it, and control and direct current lines. these items require a length of 1.5 inches and a height of 1.0 inch which includes spacing between parallel rows. the signal enters the crosspoint via the microstrip line and some of it is coupled to the amplifier. if a flip-flop circuit holds the amplifier on, then the signal passes through the amplifier to a feed-through where it leaves the row board for the column board underneath. a three-stage amplifier is used so that the control voltage, vg2, need not go negative to get a 60 de isolation through the amplifier when it is commanded open. since the three fets each receive v g2, there are three ways to turn the amplifer off should it fail on, the more serious type of failure. failure off is taken care of by path redundancy. the amplifier gets source and radio frequency ground connections from the printed circuit ground plane. there are commun buses for the drain voltages and the number one gate voltage, v gl, to which the amplifier is connected by feed- through. these lines are on the ground plane side of the printed circuit material. the switch control voltage, v g2, comes from a flip-flop on the column board. the column crosspoint shown in figure 4-5 is connected to the amplifier crosspoint by the feed-through. when the signal reaches the column board by this route, it is conducted to a second broadband wiggly coupler. the signal is coupled onto the output column line and proceeds to the transmitter amplifier for its destination city. the widths required for the output column microstrip line are so narrow that there is room available for c.iounting the dual flip-flops of third level memory onto the column beards. a study of the relationship of the row and column boards is given below. 4.2.1 three-stage amplifier a three-stage version of h.j. wolkstein\\'s dual gate mesfet amplifier will be used as the switching element for the microwave switch. three stages are necessary to achieve the required dynamic range using a unipolar gate control voltage. as shown in figure 4-6, the amplifier stages are connected in cascade. all dc bias points (v gl and vd) have been tied together, respectively, through appropriate decoupling elements, c1 and ll, to preserve system stability. the values chosen (40 pf for cl and 40 nh for ll) produce a 1000 to 1 voltage divider relationship to the rf at 4 ghz, which provides adequate isolation between stages. since this 155 if\", \"1 i zi ji cl i iqi oii ui wi 0 i uw l i - i i 1 i i\\\\t ^

prime importance during switching, the v g2 control inputs of each stage can be connected. these inputs are sufficiently decoupled to render further precautions unnecessary. figure 4-7 shows a partial physical layout of the three-stage amplifier. the mechanical design goal is to support this circuit in an area of 1.3 inches x 0.25 inch. a mechanical analysis should be performed to determine whether the circuit should be etched directly on the pc board or added to the board as a component. both approaches offer advantages and disadvantages which should be considered. 4.2.2 dual row/column board figure 4-8 shows a dual card layout study consisting of a row/column board assembly. this assembly houses a 10 x 5 crosspoint matrix and represents 1/200th of the total satellite crosspoint population. the row cards contain the input line directional couplers, the 50 ohm coupler terminations, and the three-stage fet amplifiers. the column cards consist of the output line directional couplers, their 50 ohm terminations, and the \"d\" type flip-flops. two hundred row/column board assemblies will be required to house the entire satellite crosspoint population. a significant number of rf connectors will be required. miniature ferrodisc type circulators will be located (at some card multiple) within the vertical and horizontal rf paths to maintain a satisfactory impedance match throughout the system. 4.3 microwave switch control logic configuration the design of the control system is predicated on assumptions outlined in reference 13. they are: 1.the traffic pattern through the rf switch is statistically predetermined and encounters relatively few changes during the course of a day. 2.only one switch in any row is active during a clock period of 1 microsecond (except for change of state). a knowledge of the 100 active switches in one clock period will totally specify the switch state for all 100 rows. 158 \" ai\\', \\'u vl lt ll z ll cch o ll qw 1 u (_0 q—u uw 0 ^oj

switch is up-dated every microsecond, 125 states will specify switch configurations for the complete frame. the state sequence will be known as the schedule. the schedule remains unchanged for relatively long time intervals. it will be convenient to store it in memory on board the satellite. a means of changing a portion or all of the schedule at the discretion of ground control is built into the system. 4.3.1 memory levels the control system consists of three levels of memory. the third memory level is comprised of holding registers (d flip-flops) which are in direct control of fet switches and are updated every microsecond. the second level of memory is the controlling or main memory. the switch schedule is stored here. data specifying the switch state is read out of second level memory each clock period and transferred to the appropriate fet switch holding registers. the first level of memory is used to store changes in switch states received from ground control. these changes occur infrequently. they can be transmitted to the satellite at a low data rate well in advance of implementation. the changes are transferred to main or second level memory, in response to a control command received from the ground, to update the schedule. only minimum memory requirements are covered in the system discussed. ground to satellite sync., operational checks, coding redundancies, failure identification and correction, etc., are not addressed. these functions are necessary and integral to a working system and must be incorporated at some stage of system development. 4.3.2 basic operation only one switch is active during a slot in a given row of 100 switches. a 7-bit sequence specifies this switch in binary form. specification of 100 switches in a microsecond period (a slot state) requires 700 bits. all the states of a 125 slot frame l require 700 x 125 bits for specification. this forms the basis for level 2 memory. ten blocks of 125 70-bit words are assumed (figure 4-9). each memory block is connected in turn through appropriate ii \\'\\\\t \\\\t control logic to ten 7-bit holding registers. each register is connected to a 7 x 100 decoder which selects the appropriate switch in one row of the matrix (via its d flip-flop). ten 70-bit words are read out of memory at each clock pulse (one word from each lbl r\\' i 1\", \\'c o ron •c q1 l o 4lt01 ..1 c ouvvf 01 j l 7q1 li- 162\\', \\'block) and transferred to the array of 100 7-bit holding registers which load 100 decoders. on the next clock pulse, this information is acted upon by the appropriate d flip-flop which activates and/or deactivates its companion fet switches. transfer from level 2 memory to fet switch activation requires a two-clock pulse cycle. only the time interval from d flip-flop input clock to fet switch activation is critical. this operation must be accomplished in 50 nanoseconds or less. all other transfers have a maximum of 1 microsecond for completion. no voltage translation is assumed needed between d flip-flop output and fet switch input. a microwave fet amplifier is used as the switch. the amplifier reported has a control voltage range of +1 to -2 volts for a dynamic range of 60 db. voltage translation will be avoided from positive to negative by using three stages, rather than the two stages in the circuit reported. microwave switch reaction time of 10 nanoseconds maximum is anticipated. this leaves 40 microseconds for the d flip- flop. table 4-1 shows a comparison of the present logic technologies with respect to activation delay and power consumption for d flip- flop application. from this comparison, advanced low power schottky or low power schottky would be the most appropriate in terms of speed and power consumption for the d flip-flop/fet switch interface. speed is not much of a factor for the remaining logic; therefore, low current cmos might possibly be used. 163 ie\\', \\'table 4-1 comparison of

update although the switching schedule is relatively constant over long time periods, means must still be provided for switch state update and reconfiguration via ground control. level 1 memory and its associated circuitry provide this necessary function. level 1 memory is configured as 125 blocks or pages of ten 70-bit words (with appropriate address and flag bits). see figure 4-10. each page specifies the switch state for one clock period. set flag bit. is used to inform the transfer processor that there is updated information in the level 1 memory ready to be transferred. the updated information can be loaded into level l memory over any convenient interval. the flag (transfer enable) bit is set when the transfer is to occur. a transfer processor and two counters are used to transfer switching commands from level 1 to level 2 memory. the \"a\" counter counts continuously from 0 to 124 and recycles to 0 on reaching 124. it is used to control the readout to the flip-flops of level 2 memory. the \"b\" counter also counts from 0 to 124 but stops and starts to initiate transfers from level 1 to level 2 memory. the transfer processor searches level 1 memory until it detects a flag.9 164\\', \"1^i n ^ h i v o w o ^o o j,^ ia ann naq f7: l m¢\\'7^e; ^^ ^\\\\tiw^jqq^ qq m\\\\t^ qq m\\\\t^1 qq m\\\\t7 \\' yjt u q w .^r u j sn_+ t j ^► c2 i t x9 q \\' q i s 1n s wm n

comparison is made with the running \"a\" 0 to 124 counter as to the current count. when counter \"a\" equals the contents of counter \"b\" plus 1, the transfer process is initiated. this comparison ensures the maximum amount of time for data transfer. the following illustration provides an example of the transfer process. the transfer processor encounters a transfer flag in register 50 of level 1 memory. the \"b\" counter is halted and holds at this page number. the transfer processor monitors the \"a\" counter until it reaches a count of 51. at that time, the first word in the 50th page of level 1 memory is transferred to the 50th word in the first block of level 2 memory. the 0 to 9 step counter is incremented. on the next clock pulse, the second word in the 50th level 1 memory page is transferred to the 50th word in the second block of level 2 memory. again, the 0 to 9 step counter is incremented. the transfer and increment process is continued until all ten words in the 50th page of level 1 memory have been transferred to level 2 memory. then, the 0 to 9 step counter is set to 0, the transfer enable flag in the 50th page in level 1 memory is reset, the \"b\" counter is restarted, and the searching process is continued until another transfer flag is encountered. 4.3.4 level 1 memory load the switching schedule changes slowly during the day and changes tend to repeat on a day to day basis. it is possible to store changes in additional memory on board the satellite which at some predetermined time or command from ground control would be transferred to level 1 memory via the load processor. this approach forecloses random changes which might be encountered. means must still be incorporated for direct ground update. the most flexible situation would \\\\\\' he a combination of direct and memory update capability. since direct ground update covers all possible reconfiguration situations, only this method is discussed in detail. ground update data (serial form) is read into an 82 bit shift register, whose first 12 bits are used for header (7 bits for level 1 memory page number of address, i bit for flag enable, 4 bits for level 1 memory line number). the load processor reads the header, determines the page number and whether data input or flag set. if flag/data bit indic:+tes data, then the load processor reads the line number and parallel transfers the 70 bits of data from the shift register to the appropriate position in level 1 memory. since the update period is long (hours), the level 1 memory can be loaded well in advance of update requirements. when ground control determines that switch reconfiguration should take place, it transmits a page 166\\', \\'number and flag enable command to the satellite. the load processor reads the load command and sets the flag bit on the corresponding page of level 1 memory. 4.4 internal electromagnetic compatibility self generated electromagnetic interference (emi) is examined in this subsection. cross-coupling from one control line to another must be minimized in the nasa switch. the possibility of the harmonics from the control line coupling to the rf circuitry should also be addressed. certain assumptions are made in order to form an estimate of the level of cross-coupling and the harmonic content of the switching pulses at the signal frequency. • the signal pulse has a rise and decay time of 20 nanoseconds and a minimum length of 1 microsecond. the highest repetition rate is 16.5 khz. the pulse is illustrated in figure 4-11. s the mutual impedance of the adjacent control line elements is essentially that of a parallel conductor transmission line. • the length of the control lines are short compared to the wavelength associated with the 16.5 khz. • since the control lines are electrically short, the self- impedance is that of the load, that is, the input impedance of the fet gate. the equivalent circuit of the input gate is se.own in figure 4-12. 4.4.1 harmonics of the switching pulse on the signal lines it is conceivable that some harmonic power from the rapid rise and fall times of the relatively low frequency switching pulse train could be present and injected, by some unspecified mechanism, on the signal lines. since this would represent a stray pulse, its presence would be unwelcome. the calculation of the actual coupling from the switch control lines in the ground plane is a tedious task. an upper bound can be set by assuming 1:1 coupling and looking at the harmonic content of the switching pulse. if the level of any of the harmonics in or near the satellite receive band is within 20 db of the anticipated 161 0\\', \\'cn nc o a «c c aniad 7 01 lfi-n\\\\t^e\\\\tn ln za if\\\\tn\\\\t it\\\\tif h- p r o ..nr o oi c k r ^c

line another internal emi likely to be present is that of a switching pulse being transferred in part to an adjacent switching control line and which causes some malfunction of the switch. since the switch itself is basically an fet amplifier, a signal datum could partially penetrate even though the saturation level of the switch element has not been reached. the directional couplers are 171 r\", \"172 0taken as being about 20 db devices and the switching fet in the off condition another 40 db or so. if no malfunction is to occur, the line-to-line coupling threshold should be at least 20 db below the combination, in excess of about -80 db. the approach to calculating cross coupling is to consider the self and mutal impedances z 11, z12, place a forcing function on one line, and then determine the resulting current. from, v\\\\t z11\\\\t z12\\\\t it 0\\\\t z21\\\\t z22i\\\\t 12 -z21 i1\\\\t \\'\\\\t- -vz12 i2 2\\\\t z22\\\\t1\\\\tz11 the control gate circuit configuration of

electrically short compared to the wavelength associated with the switching frequency and the self-impedance terms, z 11 and z12, are essentially that of the load itself. with the values shown in figure 4-12, zgs = z11 = z22 = 8.18 - j1.52 x 10 7 ohms. the imaginary part of the impedance dominates, and it was used for the self-impedance. the line-to-line impedance of 250 ohms was used for the mutual impedances, z12 = z21 - 250 ohms. i1 = -3.289 x 10 -7 amp 12 = -5.41 x 10 -12 amp the power cross-coupled is proportional to (i 2/i1) or, p--- 95.7 db. since this implies a margin of 36 db or wore, the system, as described, does not appear to be susceptible to this form of internal emi. 4.4.3 signal to switching line cross-coupling the inverse of the control to signal line coupling considers the case where 3 ghz signals cross-couple into the control line. the signal lines are assumed to be carrying about 1 milliwatt of signal power. the impedance of these lines is about 50 ohms referred to the ground plane. the signal is assumed to be tightly coupled to the 250 ohm balanced control lines (7.3 pf capacitor). the control output voltage is the same as the control input, about 5 volts. since nothing is known about the 3 ghz characteristics of the control load connected, a simple resistive match to the 250 ohm line was assumed. 17j r\\', \"the margin on the basis of these conservative assumptions is: m = 10 iog10 e 3i2 e0) the model which includes input and output networks as well as the fet equivalent circuit is shown in figure 4-13. by means of thevinin\\'s theorem, the current in the load, r, from 1/2 v rf (1 mw on a 50 ohm line) was calculated. the margins (referred to the 5 volt switching thresl!old) for 1.75, 3, and 4.24 ghz are: f ghz e3 volts margin 1.75 0.0104 53.7db 3.00 0.0145 50.7 db 4.25 0.0224 47.0 db the system, as configured, does not appear to be susceptible to internally generated emi from the switching pulses either on the signal lines or on adjacent switching lines. 4.5 mechanical design the memory used does not have simultaneous read and write capability. to overcome this difficulty, separate read and write clocks will be generated from a 2 mhz system clock (figure 4-14). with this circuit, the 1 mhz update rate will be maintained as specified; however, circuit reaction time will be reduced to 0.5 microsecond. analysis of the circuitry shows that this reduction can be accommodated. 4.5.1 hardware implementation level 2 memory will be configured as shown in figure 4-15. it consists of 90 cdp1823 ram ics, each containing 128 8-bit words. associated with each 128 x 8 block of memory will be two cdp1856 data bus separators for input/output isolation on the bi-directional memory data bus (figure 4-16). two additional

be used for this application. the level 3 memory and its associated control logic is configured as shown in figure 4-17. this diagram represents the traffic flow for one row of memory and requires a multiplication by 10 for the complete hardware count. the output from level 2 memory feeds 90 cdp1852 holding registers. these registers input 100 7 x 100 decoders. the decoders include a total of 1,500 3 x 8 cdp1853 decoder ics. each 7 x 100 decoder selects one of 100 d flip-flops. five thousand sn54als74 dual d flip-flop ics will be used for this application. these flip-flops are in close proximity to the actual microwave switching elements because of the rapid transfer time required. level 1 memory hardware is identical to level 2 memory (figure 4-15). it will consist of 90 cdp1823 ram ics, 182 cdp1856 bus separators, and 80 mc14050b hex buffers. the functions of the load and transfer processors can be combined into one unit that mill be designated \"input processor\" (figure 4-10). this processor will be the rca cdp1804 type with internal ram, rom and timer/counter. the serial input registers will be comprised of 11 am54ls299 type, 8-bit universal shift registers. table 4-3 summarizes the preceding information and outlines the sizing and power requirements for this control system. using present technology and the components specified, a total of 7,385 individual ics consuming a minimiun of 110 watts of input power is obtained. for timing purposes and miscellaneous functions not specified, a total of 7,500 ics is assumed. the \"d\" type flip-flop ics are housed on the dual row/column cards, which contain the microwave switching crosspoints, and are not considered here. the remaining ?cs will be mounted on cambion model x/714-1115--01-00-00 9.75 inch x 9.25 inch general purpose ic boards with provisions for 14g input/outfut terminals. the 7 x 100 decoders require the largest number of integrated circuits after the \"d\" flip-flop. each decoder requires 120

microwave drawer ten drawers are required to contain the microwave switch. each drawer contains 20 dual row/column microwave cards and ten 7 x 100 decoder cards. these cards plug into a multi-layer mother-board, which provides for the 1000 interconnections required between the d flip-flops and the 7 x 100 decoders contained in one drawer. this approach eliminates the necessity of bringing a 1000-wire cable to each drawer from the control logic. this concept is shown in figure 4-18. 4.5.3 weight estimate the weights shown in table 4-4 have been compiled through catalog references, weight measurements, and in some cases, estimation. this table indicates that the 100 x 100 crossbar microwave switch will weigh about 1000 pounds. 4.6 conclusions a dual microwave row/column crosspoint has been designed. it is compatible with the best current microwave printed circuit card practice. crosspoint size can probably be reduced. the control logic design is feasible using current technology. it represents catalog hardware rather than the latest in large scale integration and microcomputer technology. significant reduction in parts count, weight, volume, and improvement in reliability could be realized by the use of custom ls1 and ic boards for control logic. as the design proceeded, it became apparent that a number of logic control circuits should be housed on the microwave boards or in the microwave drawers. this reduced card count, eliminated cables, improved timing, and saved weight and voiusne. considerable mechanical effort is required for the following: • card mechanical design • ca- 1 ,•ounting in drawers • spacing layout in drawers 182\\', \\'cc\\\\tccua $q ac  ^qx w q p% oad 2m g1 3told c nm l10 u c .0 a 0lu c^o lo l vd 000000000\\\\td 1 l7oi ll

regions of conus as arbitrarily defined in figure a-1. this appendix further explains the matrix derivation and begins to suggest how such a matrix might be used. a.1 explanation of non-uniform traffic matrix figure a-1 and table a-1 are configured to match the current mitre baseline system for customer premises service (cps). the baseline design contains eight fixed beams and eight scanning beams, each of which visits eight coverage areas during each frame. although the traffic matrix is only 16 x 16, it represents a 72 x 72 matrix because each coverage area associated with a scanning beam is treated identically. that is, the first eight rows and the first eight columns are associated with fixed-beam areas, whereas the next eight rows and next eight columns are each associated with eight distinct areas covered by a scanning beam. traffic is assumed to be uniform in each of the scanning beam coverage areas. other assumptions are; (1) traffic leaving a given coverage area is directly proportional to the population of customer premises terminals (cpts) in that coverage area; (2) the number of cpts in a given coverage area is proportional to the population in that coverage area; (3) the fraction of traffic from a given coverage area to any coverage area is proportional to the number of cpts in the destination coverage area; (4) the total traffic leaving the largest population area, i.e., the new york city region, is normalized to unity, and the total traffic out of any other coverage area is .reduced proportionately; (5) the traffic frcm coverage area a to coverage area b is assumed to be the same as the traffic from coverage area b to coverage area a; so with the natural ordering of rows and columns, the traffic matrix is symmetrical. these assumptions reflect and attempt to model cps traffic flows which should be fundamentally different from normal telephone traffic where most of the calls are local. the traffic matrix of table a-1 was derived from

the scanning beams are each multiplied by eight for the eight scanning beam coverage areas. note that the elements in any other row or column are scaled directly from row one or column one by the relative terminal population in the coverage area corresponding to that row or column. the usefulness of this traffic matrix proposal is yet to be determined. however, some departure from the usual assumption of a uniform distribution of traffic should give satellite designers an idea of relative average traffic flows useful in implementing baseband switching concepts. for example, such a traffic matrix could indicate relative cumulative dwell times for different scanning beam areas. a.2 application of traffic matrix to baseband processor for simplicity of illustration, consider a 3 x 3 version of the traffic matrix for the hypothetical areas a, b, and c which contain terminals in proportion to the numbers 13, 6, and 1, respectively. listing the terminal populations by area accordinrj, to the rows and columns and indicating that the traffic from a row i area to a column j area is proportional to the product of the number of tt-minals in the two areas, one obtains: area:\\\\t a\\\\t b\\\\t c terminals/area: \\\\t13\\\\t 6\\\\t 1\\\\t1\\\\trow sum a:\\\\t13 169 78 13 260 b:\\\\t6 78 36 6 120 c:\\\\t1 13 6 1 20 column sum: 260 120 20 192 3\\', \"-f- - -v the equivalent traffic matrix results from normalizing all the previous entries by the maximum row or column sum: a b c a\\\\t 0.65 0.3 0.05 b\\\\t 0.3 0.138 0.0231 c\\\\t 0.05 0.0231 0.00385\\\\t• this matrix, which results from an a priori traffic model based on terminal population, is interpreted as follows. since area a has 13/20 of the total number of terminals, the aggregate collection of uplink or downlink antenna beams should cover area a 13/20 of the time, for example, on the average over many frame intervals. within this aggregation of uplink dwell or slot times, 65%, 30%, and 5% of the uplink traffic from area a is destined for downlink areas a, b, and c, respectively. similarly, within the downlinx dwell or slot times, 65%, 30%, and 5% of the downlink traffic to area a originates from areas a, b, and c, respectively. these matrix elements indicate only the a priori traffic flows, e.g., 13 = 78/6 z 0.3/0.0231 times as much traffic flows from area a to area b as from area b to area c, on the average. since user connections are continually being altered on a demand assignment basis, the average dwell or slot structure controlled by the baseband processor can be adapted to the actual traffic flows. departures from the preprogrammed averages can be implemented automatically by responding to the actual traffic statistics measured on-board by the baseb-nd processor. for example, suppose the actual traffic matrix during a particular epoch was as follows: a b c a\\\\t 0.596 0.323 0.0808 1 b\\\\t 0.25 0.154 0.0577 c\\\\tl0.0654 0.00769 0.00385 193 i\\' 3 0\", \\'this matrix has been normalized by the maximum row or column sum, which in this case is the first row. note that since the column sums are different from the corresponding row suns, the average fractional dovulink dwell or slot times for a given area are different from those for the uplink. the control of the uplink and downlink beams could be adjusted according to these row and column sums. reference 1.\\\\t\"30/20 ghz mixed user architecture development study - final report,\" nasa cr-159686, nas 3-21933, redondo beach, ca 90278: trw, inc., space systems division, october

any centralized control. this appendix addresses the feasibility of this concept by suggesting a set of subsystem parameters closely related to the baseline design and by sketching a conceptual implementation. b.1 terminals within fixed beam coverage area for the moment, consider only terminals within a fixed beam coverage area connected by a single t1-rate channel. let a super- slot consist of 2,048 frames of 1 ms duration, or 16,384 slots of 125 µs duration. the 256 frames immediately preceding this super- slot will correspond to a super-subslot of 256 ms duration, roulaly equal to a round-trip delay, which will be used to resolve contention among users of this channel. each user is assigned a unique integer from 1 to n. if a given user j has a packet to transmit, and it is his turn to do so, that user will transmit that packet if the current channel user i does nof occupy the present super-subslot. each packet is 2.048 s, or one super-slot, long. if user i occupies the present super-subslot, user j must not transmit until user i relinquishes the channel by not transmitting in a later super-subslot. meanwhile, user i continues to transr.:it packets until his buffer is empty. at this time, user j will sense that the channel is not occupied and will transmit, unless his buffer is empty. in this event, the next user k, in some predetermined order of the n indices, will have the opportunity to transmit after sensing the channel idle one super- subslot later. this procedure is called the mini-slotted alternating priorities (msap) protocol.(1]* typical channel occupancy is indicated in figure b-1. the overhead in this multiple access scheme is primarily due to the fraction of the time super-subslots are not occupied. if every user always had exactly one packet to transmit when it was his turn, the overall channel efficiency would be 2.048 s/(2.048 s t 0.256 s) = 8/9 z 89% because there would be a continuous stream of alternating occupied super-slots and unoccupied super-subslots. -peferences for appendix b are listed on page 201. 195s l\\\\\\'\"\\', \\'t n !v 196uc^o a u u c c u u due0 n 6y s^ u,a p,f 1 fq d ►+ 4. 3 0\\', \\'a question that has not yet been addressed is how user j can determine whether a particular super-subslot is occupied. if user i and j are both in the same fixed beam coverage area, as assumed above, there really is no problem since all the channel traffic is broadc*st on the downlink beam, and everyone in the net can identify unoccupied super-subslots, as well as traffic addressed to them. note that there is no need to regenerate this local network channel on-board the spacecraft other than to improve link performance by not repeating uplink interference. of course, if the signal is regenerated, there will be a serial processing delay equivalent to the length of the buffer used to temporarily store demodulated data on-board. this would not affect channel utilization efficiency in any way, however. if each user bursts at a rate of 1.5 1!4 mb/s, an average data rate of approximately r = 1.544/n mb/s can be m?intained at each of n terminals. the actual rate will be slightly le;:s than r, since the unoccupied super-subslots induce overhead inefficiency. it should also be recognized that bursty terminal traffic is implied by a low terminal duty factor 1/n. for exam ple. twenty-four 64 kb/s terminals could be accommodated by one t1-rate satellite channel if each terminal had the capability of buffering several mb of non- real-time data. the average delay experienced by a single terminal in communicating a single 2.048 s packet of (1.544 mb/s)(2.048 s) z 3.16 mb would be about (n/2)(2.048 s) ;z 24.6 s near full channel loading, since the expected number of super-slots a terminal must wait before transmitting is n/2. this delay component dominates transmission and propagation delay and ar- on-board processing delay anticipated thus far, but arises from assuming that each terminal transmits a single packet in turn. in practice, somewhat longer queueing delays are expected with heavy channel loading because in the msap protocol, a terminal transmits until its buffer is empty. on the other hand, with lighter traffic, considerably shorter average delays can be expected. the actual queueing delay formula in super-slots is given by: [2] q =\\\\ts+a (1-s) (1+ n ) 2(1-s)\\\\t2\\\\tn\\\\t 1-s 2( g\\\\t+ 2 (1-g) (1 + 1 ng ) g < n\\\\t(b•.1) g 197\\', \\'i where s = ng, g <1/n, is the expected channel throughput and g is the average terminal message load; a = 0.256 s/2.048 s = 1/8 corresponds to the one-way propagation delay between terminals in the net, i.e., a round-trip propagation delay through the satellite. the actual throughput is slightly less than s, when the overhead of the unoccupied super-subslots is taken into account. a graph of the queueing delay q in packet slots of 2.048 s each is shown in figure b-2 for two values of n, the number of terminals in the single channel net. observe that the queueing delay increases by less than a factor of two for forty-eight 32 kb/s users. b.2 terminals not within fixed beam coverage area the next question that arises is whether a similar access scheme can be utilized for terminals within a scanning beam coverage area or for arbitrarily located terminals. conceptunlly, the answer is yes, but the complexity of implementation and expected packet delay may increase for terminals in different coverage areas. b.2.1 terminals within scan ning beam area since the data transmissions are to be accomplished in non-real time, there is no longer a requirement to have a short beam dwell interval and a fast beam hopping rate, e.g., 125 jts and 8 kh/s, respectively. a straightforward way of achieving roughly the same performance as in section b.1 would be to increase the terminal burst rate by a factor of eight and to subdivide the super-subslots into eight super-minislots each of duration 32 ms, as shown in figure b-3. the scanning beam would dwell on a given coverage area for a 32 ms interval every eight super-minislots, or every 256 ms. it would still take a terminal 2.048 s, or eight scanning beam periods to deliver essentially the same amount of data corresponding to one packet of section b.1, the difference being that this block of data is now delivered in eight packets of 8(1.54 mb/s)(32 ms) 395 kb each. the differences in channel bit overhead resulting from the need for burst synchronization is negligible because of the very long packet lengths compared to the tens of bits needed for synchronization. the typical channel occupancy indicated in figure b-3 is analogous to that of figure b-1. except for the eight scanning beam coverage areas and the higher burst rate; channel efficiency, throughput, and delay performance (see equation (b.1) and figure b-2) would be nearly identical to that of section 3.1. 198 3 f\\', \\'0 rdn oto c n1a0 • 0cr 1 80 dw 00

user j in area b. the need to recognize the destination address for satellite switching and to maintain the distributed control aspect of the access scheme forces on-board regeneration. it is convenient to think of the channel as being separated into an uplink channel for all source users like user i and a collection of downlink channels for all destination users like user j. the only information that must be broadcast to the uplink users on a downlink to area a to maintain the msap protocol is the ozcupancy status of the uplink channel, not the message packets themselves. this information can be transmitted by having the satellite processor sense the unoccupied slots and by using a fixed beam, conus coverage, low rate, downlink orderwire channel which broadcasts the uplink access channel indices of only those channels which have just experienced an unoccupied msap contention slot. uplink users of these channels would monitor this downlink broadcast and would have the opportunity to transmit packets on those channels immediately if it is their turn in the msap protocol. packets successfully transmitted to the satellite would be routed to the appropriate downlink under the usual switching control procedures for non-real-time, or even real-time, traffic. references 1.fouad a. tobagi, \"multiaccess protocols in pa ,ket: communication systems,\" ieee trans.

uplink signals followed by the multiplication and accumulation of b-bit quantized samples. the second approach utilizes cordic rotation which may have implementation advantages in realizing the multiplication functions. c.1 a/d conversion the essential issues of analog-to-digital ( a/d) conversion are the quantization level and sampling speed. samples of the analog if signal are \"snapshots\" of the real values at uniformly spaced discrete times. each of these real values is approximated by one of a finite number of levels using a quantization rule. each level is represented by a finite number of binary digits (bits). c.1.1 number of quantization bits required the received signal is assumed to be sampled, limited, and quantized according to standard techniques using the 2\\\\\\'s complement representation of binary numbers with rounding.[1]* a central issue is the number of bits require\\\\\\' to adequately represent a composite received waveform of bandwidth w containing a desired signal of bandwidth b, corresponding to the channel burst rate. using the 1 b/s per hz assumption of the baseline design, this implies that the number of fdma user signals in the waveform is n sz w/b. the usual nyquist complex sampling rate w (complex samples/s) is assumed. let a be the received magnitude of the desired signal, let n-1 be the number of simultaneous in-band fdma signals, each with received power i times larger than the desired signal, and let c be the clip level factor, i.e., the input waveform is clipped at a level c times above the measured rms level to maintain a certain fidelity criterion. if the received waveform has mean zero and variance ow, if the variance of the channel noise is 0z, and if b is the number of quantization bits, not including sign, then the operative criterion is to select b large enough to ensure that the references for appendix c are on page 211. 202\\', \\'quantization noise variance c oo w /12 exp s 2b is much less

state-of-the-art of a/d converters for purposes of this appendix, a/d converter data relative to the demodulation process, i.e., table c-1, has been extracted from section 3.9.4 of this report and developed here. in the group demodulator- approach, the sampling rate would be equal to the 100 mhz cps bandwidth. according to table c-1, a 3 to 5-bit a/d converter is required since there are several simultaneous signals being demodulated within that bandwidth. a/d converters in this category are not beyond the state-of-the-art according to figure 3-28, section 3.9,:1, e.g., trw\\'s 400 mhz, 5-bit a/d using silicon logic, but they may well consume: too much power for satellite use. however, trw has achieved low power (0.25 to 2 w), 4 to 8-bit, silicon (si) a/d converters operating at 30 mhz and has predicted the feasibility of 4 to 8-bit a/d converters consuming only about 0.05 to 2 w at 1 gliz using gallium arsenide (gaas) logic. it is estimated that gaas a/d converters of adequate quantization and speed could be developed for a 1990 satellite to permit all digital group demodulation. the power consumption of each a/d converter should be only a fraction of a watt. assuming 0.3 w per a/d converter, based on a trw prediction for 6 bits at 1 ghz, the thirty-two a/d converters in the all digital demodulation approach to the baseline design would consume a total of only 9.6 w. recall that there are sixteen uplink antenna beams and the same 100 mhz if bandwidth in each beam. two a/d converters are required per beam, one for the in-phase group signal and one for the group signal in phase quadrature. 204\", \\'a more conservative scheme, which would bypass problems with a/d converters operating at 100 mhz sampling rates, is the individual mixing-down or frequency translation to baseband of each fdma signal in the 100 mhz bandwidth. this typically would require sixteen 12.3 mhz a/d converters per uplink beam with only 2-bit quantizations. (see table c-1.) these parameters provide the other, and perhaps more realistic, benchmark leading to the total power consumption of the demodulators. in this case these a/d converters would consume 64 w total, even with a 4-bit quantization at 30 mhz. in order to stay within the postulated weight and power budget mentioned in section 3, the demodulators should not require more than a few hundred watts. this would allow ample power for the signal acquisition and tracking and symbol synchronization circuitry as well as rf front-end hardware. c.2 multiplier approach in general, the baseband modulations will be detected at the satellite receivers using two quadrature channels each with two multiplications per input sample, one corresponding to the local carrier reference mixing operation and one corresponding to multiplication by a baseband window. (see appendix e.) assuming a sampling rate of w complex samples/s, m uplink beams, and n chancels per beam, the number of multiplications/s required is 4wmn. if a single multiplication time is d, then the minimum number of multipliers required is l = 4wmnd. \\\\t (c.3) if p is the power required to operate a single multiplier, then the total power for implementing the multiplication process is at least lp. p is a function of b, d, and the logic family or other implementation employed in the multiplication. for a fixed b and for a given implementation, the faster the multiplication, the higher the power consumption. in a power-limited situation, twice the number of multipliers might be operated at half the speed with some mechanism for time-sharing the hardware to produce the same number of multiplications/s with less power. similarly, in a speed- limited situation, several slower multipliers might be \"pipelined\" for achieving a required throughput multiplication rate. the number of multipliers required and their attendant power consumption is estimated for the typical baseline parameters 205 3\\', \"w = 100 mhz, n = 8 or 64, and m = 16. from ,qustion (c.3), the minimum nvkber of multipliers needed in any demodulation scenario is 5.12 x 10 d and 4 .096 x 10 11 d for n = 8 and 64, respectively. note that if the multiplication time d is 10 to 100 ns, then hundreds or thousands of multipliers are required; the n = 64 channel/beam scenario may prove to be particularly troublesome. it can be inferred from figure 3-26 of section 3.9.4 that gaas multipliers offer attractive speed /poi►er products for this application while si devices cannot be considered serious contenders. in that figure, power data are presented for the number of multipliers per channel which are the least multiple of four not less than 4wd, cf. equation (c.3). this can result in a surplus of multipliers from the minimum required, but possible problems of multiplexing and/or switching among shared multipliers is avoided. however, pipelining and buffering of intermediate results is necessary. the total power lp for implementing the multipliers is given in table c-2 for several baseline parameter combinations of interest using the gaas data from figure 3-26 of section 3.9.4. it is clear that 64 channels per \\'beam is infeasible if the demodulators are limited to several hundred watts of power. as indicated in table c-1, b = 3 is insufficient for n = 64. however, 8 channels per beam is quite pos¢ibie even with 8 bits of quantization which is more than enough according to table c-1. table c-2 upper bound on total power (w) consumed by b x b gaas multipliers for w = 100 mhz end m = 16 b 3\\\\t 5\\\\t 8 8\\\\t 28.8\\\\t102.4\\\\t204.8 n 64\\\\t 230.4\\\\t819.2\\\\t1638.4 c.3 cordic rotator approach reduced to its essentials, in cordic rotation ^2], each complex input sample from the a/d converter is to be multiplied by another complex number generated by the local mixing and windowing operations. instead of doing this multiplication in the usual fashion, there may be advantages in recognizing that the local 206 i\", \\'reference signal has no variation in amplitude but only in phase, for constant envelope modulations (see appendix e), and rotating the incoming sample in the complex plane by an angle 6 specified by the local reference. actually, 9 is quantized and varies with each sampling instant. each quantized rotation is accomplished by a series of quantized mini-rotations, where each successive mini- rotation represents a smaller angle. the sign of the mini-rotation is determined by the sign of the difference between the desired rotation angle 8 and the current approximation to 8 after the previous mini-rotation. the actual mini-rotation of the incoming complex sample is accomplished by successively changing the sign (or not) and interchanging the real and imaginary parts of shifted binary versions of the complex sample. the shifting is accomplished very simply by means of binary shift registers and is made possible by the fact that the mini-rotation angles possess tangents which are powers of one-half. a more precise description follows. c.3.1 cordic model the basic function is to multiply the input sample (i,q) by g exp(je), where g is a small gain constant. the effect is a rotation by 8 and slight stretching of the vector (i,q^ in the complex plane. it is easy to implement a rotation by 6 x 8 through a sequence of k mini-rotations involving angles of 7r, 7r/2, and angles which have tangents of 1/2, 1 /4, etc., as listed in table c-3; 9 is given by k b\\\\tr-17f + r0 2 + \\\\t rk tan-1 2-k k-1\\\\t(c.4) where the coefficients, which are yet to be determined, assume the values r - 1, r 0 - (0.1) and rk - (1,-1) . k - 1, ... , k. the gain constant g k approximating g can be expressed as (see table c-3) -2kck - kn1(1 + 2 \\\\t (c.5a) and it can be shown that g - hi-m w gk - 1.1646.

(also, see section 3.9.3.1) d.1 sawd implementation examples many surface acoustic wave devices (sawds) have metallic interdigital transducers for launching or detecting an acoustic wave on the surface of a piezoelectric crystal. the physical shape of the transducer is used to control the response of the device, e.g., sawd filters with fixed impulse or frequency response can be fabricated easily; some of the lowest cost sawd filters can be found in commercial television receivers. adaptive devices with programmable responses are possible but are more complex and more expensive, and some of these are still in the research stage. in contrast to the fixed sawds which use metallic or etched patterns, a family of programmable acoustoelectric devices that a « insensitive to temperature variations exists.[\\']* some of the general characterisites of sawr)s are listed in table 3-2 of section 3. the potential for low volume, weight, and cost is particularly attractive. this is explored here briefly for several sawd applications. d.l.l generation of msk modulation minimum shift keying (msk) is one of the bandwidth and power efficient modulations highlighted in mitrf.\\'s first year report for nasa/lerc.[2] although msk is an increasingly popular modulation, it is being surpassed in performance by the advanced modulation/coding schemes of appendix e. on the other hand, the implementation of msk is well understood, and much remains to be done in achieving practical realizations of some of the modern techniques. in particular, the use of sawds in the generation and detection of various modulations is of interest. trefe^ernces for appendix d are listed on page 219. 212\", \\'the dramatic simplification possible in the generation of msk with the introduction of sawn is evident in figure d-1. conventional schemes are rather ponderous, though effective. the functionally equivalent sawd scheme employs a bi-phase modulated pulsed sinusoid at one signaling frequency to drive a sawd filter wit- an impulse response consisting of a pulsed sinusoid at the other signaling frequency. details of this continuous phase shift modulated (cpsm) waveform implementation can be found in the literature.[3] d.1.2 uhf oscillators since sawn operate in the vhf/uhf range, considerable savings in weight and volume may be achieved by rf (or even if) operation at several hundred mhz.\\\\\\' sawn employed as oscillators can achieve a 20:1 advantage over more conventional approaches, as suggested by figure d-2. d.1.3 reflective array compressors the reflective array cor; l,ressor (rac), invented by r. c. williamson of the m.i.t. lincoln laboratory, is one of the earlier signal processing devices using saws. this device is particularly useful for the generation or matched filter detection of a chirp signal, i.e., an elementary waveform which has an instantaneous frequency that varies linearly with time. chirp waveforms can be used as a means of spreading the signal spectrum for achieving a multiple access interference rejection capability, for example. the rac shown in figure d-3 can he used to generate a \"down\" chirp by applying a time-domain impulse at the input transducer, or as a matched filter for an \"up\" chirp. in either case, the incoming higher frequencies propagate shorter distances into the device until their wavelengths match the spacings of the etched grooves or \"fingers\". lateral reflections across the device occur at these points and the waves propagate in the opposite direction toward the ^magnetostatic-wave (msw) devices that perform some of the functions of sawn are becoming available. msw devices operate directly at microwave frequencies of 1 to 20 ghz with bandwidths of 0.5 to 1 ghz. however, delays of only 10 to 500 ns are possible.

impulse, and an impulse delayed by twice the rac length divided by the saw propagation speed v results from an up chirp. maximum time dispersions (delays) of t = 100 ns or more are attainable with racs of 18 cm or more in length for a common piezoelectric material, lithium niobate, which has a propagation speed of approximately 3500 m/s. the state-of-the-art in growing sufficiently pure crystals limits the maximum delay. wavelengths are limited on the low side by the lithographic state-of-the-art of several microns (um) in etching fingers. hence, maximum frequencies of fh = v/ah are limited to hundreds of mhz. the rac bandwidth is the difference between the highest and lowest tunable frequencies, or w = fh- fl = 100 mhz, in this instance. the time-bandwidth product, or so-called processing gain, of the rac shown is tw = 104 = 40 db. racs can also be used as components for realizing chirp-z transforms for frequency analysis [4], and for fast, coherent synthesizers for frequency hopping waveforms.[5] d.2 ccd signal processing charged coupled devices (ccds) are used in a wide variety of signal processing applications in communications technology, notably in the single ic-chip filtering of analog, sampled-data signals.[6] the basic principle consists of the serial, weighted transfer of analog quantities of electrical charge at discrete times corresponding to uniformly spaced sampling instants of the continuous input signal. as with sawds, the usual process of a/d conversion is avoided. an example of higher-order signal processing state-of-the-art using only ccds was produced recently for the u.s. army by texas instruments, inc.[7] this development resulted in a general purpose ic chip of ccds capable of performing a 512-point discrete fourier transform (dft) using the chirp-z transform algorithm. the chip includes four ccd recirculating transversal filters for performing convolutions, four 10-bit multiplying digital-to-analog (d/a) converters (mdacs) for performing multiplications, ccd clock logic and drivers, four amplifiers, and control logic, buffers, and other support hardware. the processor operated at a clocking rate of up to 1 mhz with more than 60 db of dynamic range; power dissipation at 1 mhz was 475 mw. the complete ic chip measures 6.1 mm x 5.5 mm. 217 i 0\\', \"d.3 hybrid sawd/ccd accumulating correlator when

of the result, depending on whether information is coded into the phase or the slope of the elementary chirps. in any event, since the f(jt) is generally a wideband signal which may be difficult to sample wits, sufficient precision for coherent detection, a form of non-coherent (envelope) detertic\\'u is often employed in conjunction with two sawds, one matched to an up chirp and one matched to a down chirp. this reduces the problem to the detection of i f.j01, which eliminates the ci dependence, as sf v i from equation (d.1). although this may simplify the receiver by relaxing the timing requirements, the performance is degraded by up to several decibels in yn o compared with the coherent detection of binary antipodal signals in awgn. the actual degradation depends on the cross-correlation coefficient of the elementary signals, which in turn depends on the time-bandwidth product of the chirp. for time-bandwidth products of ten or more, the up and down chirps are nearly orthogonal, i.e., their cross-correlation coefficient can be taken as zero, for a 3-db loss compared to antipodal signals. in general, for these reasons it may be desirable to use a hybrid sawd/ccd matched-filter detector or correlator to demodulate communications signals. the sawd provides the wideband input capability and the ccd slows down the output for easier detection. a single device like this is under development at the m.i.t. lincoln laboratory.[8] 218\", \\'references 1.john h. cafarella, \"acoustoelectric surface wave devices for programmable signal processing,\" proc. intern.

still focused only on constant envelope (ce) modulations. it is true that there are good non-ce modulations for use on bandlimited and nonlinear channels, and that ce modulations lose the ce property on such channels.[33 nevertheless, the trend toward smaller terminals and the premium on transmitter power amplifier efficiency for such terminals favors ce modulations. this prevents distortions in the transmitted signal by the highly nonlinear power amplifier operating in the saturated class c mode for high efficiency. furthermore, it has been shown that coded ce waveform with very attractive bandwidth and power efficiencies exist.[41 it remains to discover some of the better codes and to explore further the synchronization requirements of these advanced modulations. the improved performance promised is extracted with increased demodulation complexity. this system trade-off is expected to be favorable to the extent that receiver complexity can be handled with low cost vlsi circuitry. practical implementation difficulties may continue to provide opportunities for other waveform designs, however, such as simpler ce modulations and non-ce modulations. for instance, in some of the advanced ce waveforms discussed, the relatively small phase changes inherent in the modulation tends to make synchronization more difficult. added receiver hardware required could be traded for linear power amplifiers at the transmitters, for example. a general principle in communication theory is to unify the design of the source/sink, coder/decoder (codec), and modulator/demodulator (modem) so as to be more effective in connecting end users with equipment and techniques well-matched to the problem and the channel. in particular, one should not design the codec independently of the modem. this was the usual practice up to a few years ago until it became better known that several decibels of increased coding gain could be obtained by making soft *references for appendix e are

families, whose frequency pulses he denotes by ld and lrc, are defined as follows. o ld frequency pulses an ld frequency pulse has l-2 continuous derivatives, extends over the l symbol interval (0, lt), and has an integral of 1/2; cf. equation (e.2). the analytical expressions for the first four pulses in the family, sketched in figure e-1, are od: f(t) - z u 0(t) (impulse of area 1/2 located at the origin) 1d: f(t) - 1 1u _1(t) - u_1(t-t)1 (rectangle of height 1/2t and width t) 2d: f(t) - 212 [u-2(t) - 2u_ 2(t-t) + u-2(t-2?)3 (isoceles triangle of height 1/2t and base 2t) 3d: f(t) - 21 t3

whict will not be explained here. the present discussion is limited to some definitions and a sampling of relevant results. the alphabet size m equals the number of possible underlying phase jump choices in the received signal of energy e for a given symbol interval of duration t. the modulation index is restricted to a rational number h = r/q, where q is the total number of underlying phases (modulo 27r),and r is an integer relatively prime to q, i.e., the greatest common divisor of r and q is unity: g.c.d.(r, q) = 1. this restriction on modulation index results in underlying phase changes which are multiples of 27r/q and permits a finite state markov model when phase changes are selected at random (with the jump increment 27rr/q). this also results in a phase tree which collapses into a trellis of finite states similar to those used in the viterbi decoding of convolutional codes.[6] the parameter q is analogous to the number of quantization levels in soft-decision decoding. since q is an indicator of receiver complexity, it should be selected to be as small as possible without compromising r ob, i.e., q should be just large enough to yield the 228\\', \\'o;(t)

as a function of e/n o, where no is the single-sided noise power speceral density. significant improvement in r is attained by increasing m from 2 to 4. as indicated in figure e 23, the dashed m = q = 2 curve, corresponding to antipodal signaling like binary phase shift keying (bpsk) (od smoothing) and msk (1d smoothing), achieves a maximum of only 1 b/symbol at about 6 db e /n(n = eb/no, where furthermore, this performance degrades considerably as the number of possible underlying phases increases. a substantial increase in r. is evident with m = q = 4 and r = 1, even for the 2d and 3rc smoothed baseband shapes. the classical channel capacity limit log m c\\\\tt2 w t (b/s) b(e.18) of 2 b/symbol is approached fairly closely in the 10 to 12 db range of e/no (or 7 to 9 db in e b/no), depending on the degree of smoothing. recall that the 2d ane. 3rc frequency pulses have zero and one continuous derivative, respectively. performance can be improved further by doubling the alphabet size to m = 8 where a capacity of 3 b/symbol is approached at slightly smaller e/no\\\\\\'s (eb/no\\\\\\'s in the 5 to 7 db range, approximately). although relatively little decrease in r o is observed with increased smoothing, much greater bandwidth efficiencies can result. e.3.2 bandwidth efficien a single-sided x-db signal bandwidth b is defined by j b0 s(f) df x\\\\t- 10 log

.8 = c/b and identifying the bit time tb with 1/c according to equation (e.18). plotting 2/#= 2bt b on the vertical axis to be consistent with anderson,(4) this capacity reference is indicated in figure e-4. no modulation/coding scheme can fall below this limit. it is useful to compare the bandwidth efficiencies of phase coded waveforms with specific baseband modulation shapes to the shannon limit of equation (e.20). here bandwidth efficiency is measured by the difference between the 2btb value of a particular modulation, using a specified x-db bandwidth, and the capacity reference, both evaluated at the same e b/no value. note that a mapping between e b/no and ro exists through curves like those of figure e-3 for the same modulation scheme, when the bound parameter can be computed. the power efficiency is measured by the value of e eb/no required. naturally, lower values of eb/no and 2bt b are desired. the bandwidth and power efficiencies for 1d and 3rc smoot ing for m = 4 and x = 20 db and 40 db bandwidths are shown in figure e-4 for various modulation indices. it has been observed that bandwidth efficiency is improved more efficiently by decreasing h rather than increasing m above 4. as a reminder, the 1d frequency pulse is discontinuous while the 3rc frequency pulse has one continuous derivative. this accounts for the greatly improved bandwidth efficiency of the smoother pulse for x = 40 db; the spectral sidelobes roll-off as 12 and 24 db per octave for 1d and 3rc, respectively. 232\\', \\'o m 4 w vzw q w uj/ ccw c n /\\\\\\'hm tozo^=1\\\\\\'\\\\tq \\\\\\'-

e\\\\t network tailored to the chosen power stage in order to optimize the overall system performances. the lack of a unified control method and design strategy often necessitates the undertaking of time consuming i 1 r\\', \"paper and bench design iterations which frequently result in incoilr- \\\\tc patibin and intricate performance characteristics.t the incentive for performance improvement a nd control standardization had prompted the initial development of a \\'multiple-- loop control concept in the late sixties [l]. since then, the control concept has undergone several major program offort.s, modell culminate, in the \\\\t 4 ott development of a standardized control, module (^c&m) for do-de converters (2,3j. figure 1.1 illustrates the scm applied to the three basic power stages, buck, boost and buck/boost. the scsi contains all analog signal processor (asp) and it digital signal processor (usr.) . implemen tations of both asp and usp are sta ►ndairdi pd. the key feature of the scm is the utilization of an inherent at switching -frequency siinal, within the power stage. the utilization is in- addition to the conventional do sensing of output voltage v, and comparing with a reference fr. 9 the sensed at signal and the do error are processed by the asp. as a result, total--stage control, is obtained. the bsp processes the control- signal output from the asp in conjunction with a prescribed duty-cycle control law, and operates the on--o fd: of the power switch via a duty cycle signal d in reference (3), a detailed description on the digital signal processol . was provided. a standardized implementation scheme for various >oatrol, command, and protection blocks was proposed, and actuaal. hardware implementation was performed s;accessfully on the three converter configurations, buck, buck/boost, and the parallel \\\\t a inverters. the following performance improvements were observed and verified in rev ent: modeling and analysis efforts as discussed ^\\'\", \"t f 3 1 k t cq i ^ ft ^t 1 t a. tow° wo\\\\tup ^zz qh;fvvj\\'utim o 9 t ix n m lo) ui f { r-i z o ww i_) hi^. dclfpui- 3\", \"ii in detail in volume 1 of this report, application handbook for a standardized control module for dc-dc converters.\\' (1)high-gain, wide-bandwidth, and precision regulation (2)superior dynamic performances, such as taudiosusceptibility \\\\t e and transient response (3)stabilisation effect by shifting the positive zero oat the right-half 9-plane to the left-half s-plana.

(1) the analog signal processor; and (2) the digital signal processor. the analog signal processor, employing three feedback loops (dc, ac, and compensation loops), processes the error signals to achieve optimal control. for various loop-dependent por.formances such as stability, audio sus cep t bili,t y, and transient responses the digital signal processor processes all incoming control signals including error signals front regulator control loops, command and protection and duty cycle timing signals. a brief description for bath the analog signal processor and the pulse modulator is provided in the following._ (a) analog signal processor. three input signals are applied to the amplifier through three feedback hoops working in unison. the do loop senses the output of the regulator and compares it to the reference voltage g to generate a` do error signal, e\\'in conjunction with an externally-generated threshold level ;c t, the do output of the amplifier is determined by e, do* this loop is no different than that of any other single-loop error amplifier. the ac loop senses, the ac voltage across the energy storage inductor. since the inductor voltage is of rectangular 7 sx.\", \\'----------------------------- ------^ cc jin t\\\\t i\\\\t^^ l 6jn\\\\t^ \\\\t ^ w\\\\t \\\\\\':u ilx-c\\\\tx1p \\\\t > „^ \\\\tw lk rij\\\\t fw,---^^\\\\\\'\\\\t +c„i\"`-=- ---------- \\\\t ----- n\\\\t •\\\\t x\\\\t i,^ l\\\\\\'\\\\t^i\\\\\\' c\\\\t°w\\\\ta\\\\t  .., \\\\t e_\\\\t o0.1woil 4 f\\\\t co.m\\\\t ea\\\\t1-0 lu 46 z u.\\\\t o\\\\tp~ >\\\\t > qo\\\\t r^r \\\\tn^\\\\t ^ yy\\\\t _^\\\\t.r\\\\\\'^..=^.qp \\\\ton\\\\t w \\\\\\'uu\\\\t ^^c air1 1 ^{\\', \"waveform, a triangular ramp is conveniently achieved through the integration of the rectangulz.^- voltage. in this caso the amplifier is configured with capacitive feedback to serve ttho dual function of amplification and integrat ion. the: third loop, an rc compensation network, senses any change in.dv0/dt, and feeds this information to 8 the integrator amplifier in order to improve regulator performance. the significance of this network is described in detail in volume 1, and in references (4,5,6,7)\\\\t1 (2) disital signal processor. the digital signal processor (pulse modulator) is the nerve center of the +control system, and must process all incoming control signals and transmit the correct output signal tcti operate the, power switch. the sign^l { processed by the digital signal processor encompasses control signals and protection/command signals. the sch is capable of operating in several different duty cycle 1 control modes based on different: ramp and threshold-level implementations: 1) pulse frequency modulati on. -o constant t n variable • constant t f, variable tn 2)pulse with modulation -- constant frequency with variable t and variable tf 3)nixed pulse width and pulse frequency modulation - two\\' threshold-level. control, with variable frequency, variable t and \\'variable tf. 9\\\\t;\", \\'the standardized implementation of the digital signal processor including various du ty-cycle, control, command, and protection signals is discussed in detail in ttaference (3). 2.2 merits of scm the electrical performance of a power processor depends, to a ,large extent, on the quality of its control system. while numerous control circuits have been proposed and are in use today, most of these circuits suffer shortcomings that tend to restrict their utility. the 0cm, on the y other hand, overcomes many of these short- comings. some features of the $cm are: 1)\\\\tability to perform different modes of duty-cycle control,. various control laws can he used to govern (modulate) the power switch conduction (on) and nonconductor (off) inter vals to achieve a given control objective. the available means of timing implementation axe: constant on-time t n,, variable off time t f; constant tf, variable t n; constant (tn + tf), variable t n and tf; variable tn, + tf). while it is quite often true that the means employed tf, and (tn  to accomplish the control objective is irrelevant as long as all specifications are met, there are certain po^.fer processors for which the use of specific mean rs of duty-cycle control is necessary. for example, requirements on synchronization and electromagnetic compatibility may dictate a control based on constant (tn + t f), whereas in certain lc resonant applications, the ;sinusoidal current in the power switch for one half of the lc resonant cycle inherent ly demands a control based on a constant tn and a variable t f. under special circumstances, one 10\\', \"particular modulation schema may offer distinct advantages over another from the point of view of protection or transient response. (2)ability to rovide ower-com ponent stress limitin g, one of the moat lagging aspects of present power processing technology is reliability, the reliability of the power processors can be greatly enhanced by controlling the power component stresses during steady state, and more sig,%ificantly, during dynamic operations such as step line and /or load changes, sudden output short circuiting, and converter starting. without this stress control., the rel,inbili,ty data based on the aggregation of component statistical failure rates becomes meaningless, and no amount of elaborate quality assurance can increase the level of confidence. thus in the magneti.e- semiconductor, transient-prone power processors, the means of achieving reliability enhancement is to implement circuit techniques to instantaneously limit the electrical stresses in all power processor components, thus en- suring safe operation during steady state and transients. existing power processors often forsake this limiting function, and rely instead on generous derating of all power components to foster reliable operations. such a practice forces the power processor to remain at the mercy of uncontrolled j.\\'ransient stresses and will inevitably become impractical in future high power applications. (3)ability to provide immunity to output-filter parameter changes. sources of output-filter parameter changes include initial component tolerances, temperature variations, aging, and most significant,, the possible reactive nature of the power-processor load. it is not uncommon for a user\\'s load package to have an input filter with higher capacitance than that of the power- processor output filter. a power processor seldom\", \\'enjoys the luxury of having the nature of its loads well defined when it is under development. as a result, the compensation networks of most existing control circuits are devised from consideration of the power-processor output filter alone assuming a resistive load. exotic means of pole-zero cancellation have been the prevailing art used in negating the second-order filter effect to achieve stability and well- damped respdiises. needless to say, such a cancellation can miss its mark badly when tolerance, temperature, aging, and reactive loading have collectively made their presence felt. (4)ability to provide adaptive compensation to the moving poles. the complex poles of the boost and buck/boost converters are affected by the duty cycl-e of the power switch. the duty=cycle variation which results from line voltage changes is known to produce two moving poles (9,10) which are very difficult to compensate when con- ventional control means are used. because of these moving poles, a well compensated regulator, stable under nominal operating conditions, can become unstable under extreme line/load conditions. the scm control can provide second-order zeros adaptive to the moving poles of the power stage. the stability margins are therefore maintained throughout the entire operating range.

of these blocks was performed in\\\\\\' volume x. subsequently, the common ;frequency domain block \\\\t f diagram shown in\\\\t1.2 was developed. this common block diagram representation is employed in the present report for performance 15\\', \"3 i iy 9 e { ^ievaluations, and later, control-circuit design. for convenie nce of reference, the transfer functions for all blocks shown in fig. 1.2 are summarized in table 3.1 for each power stage. only the continuous inductor current mode is considered in this volum e. a brief description for each block is given in the following. a. power stage transfer functions f l, f d, fig, zp, fl, f2, f3 and f4: the power stage transfer function model incorporates all possible forms of small signal disturbances including the line disturbances vi, the load disturbance i o, and the duty cycle disturbance d. this model provides both do and ac error signals to the analog signal processor. the power stage transfer functions are defined as follows: fp(s):\\\\tequivalent output filter transfer fun- \\'tion. fz(s):\\\\tinput voltage gain, (f 1fp represents the open loop input-to output-voltage transfer function). fd(s): duty cycle gain, (f dfp represents the duty-cycle-to-output- voltage gain). fp(s) the output impedance of the open-loop converter power stage, (z p 1 o reps rents the open-loop output voltage variation due to the load current disturbance io) the next two transfer functions are ;employed to provide the ac error signal (the voltage across the ac loop sensing winding voltage vat shown in fig. 1.1): f1 (s)and f2 (s):\\\\ttogether, these functions provide the small-signal low-frequency ac inductor current (or magnetic \\'flux) due to disturbances from the output voltage v o and duty cycle d. 16\", \"it should be noted that the feed-forward path through f exists for the boost and buck/boost converters because the inductor for these two configurations is separated from the output filter capacitor by a switch. as a result the equivalent inductance in the small- signal model-is modulated by the duty cycle of the switch. f3(s): impedance function employed to convert the inductor current or magnetic flux into an ac error voltage v acs) across the sensing winding. f4 (s): transfer func tion characterizing the amount of dis turbance of the inductor current due to load disturbance. b.analog signal.

the \\'same form. this .finding has significant impact on the basic design philosophy. it is commonly known that the small signal, characteristic off:, the boost and buck/boost converters, unlike the buck converter, has ap6sitive zero which introduces addition \\'phase\\' delay. employing a conventional single-loop control, an additional compensati\\'or acneme is needed to stabilize the converter. nevertheless. 24;\", \\'when scm is employed the positive zero of the boost or buck /boost converter is shifted to the left-half a-plane such that the open loop characteristics for all three converters share a common form. in addition a second-order zero is generated by sch control to compensate the second -order pole of the output filter. the scm has thus mitigated to a large extent. the particular instability concerns of boost and buck/boost regulators.

considerations one can conclude that the minimization of zf(a) anti hf(a) at filter resonance is the key to designing an input filter for a switching regulator with a given power stage. and ,specified sine and load conditions. in conventional single-stage input-:filter design, the per- formance degradations are often compensated by using a larger filter i l and c, or by using an externally added r in series with filter l or c to bring the resonant peaking under control. in any case, the designer has to suffer the penalty of increased size, weight, and loss. a satisfactory filter design becomes rather difficult to achieve without wtrading one or more performance characteristics for size, weight, or efficiency. an optimum, two=stage input =filter configuration as shown in e fig. 4.7 was

single -stage  filter were used. 4.5. input filter related scm design guidelines. high-gain and wide- bandwidth is one of the intrinsic characteris- ti s of switching regulators employing scm control. typical open loop cross-over frequency occurs at 1/3 to 1/2 of the switching fre- quency. because of the stringent military specifications on conducted interference requirement, the loop gain reduction due to an input filter usually occurs at a frequency approximately a half decade or even a decade prior to the open-loop crossover frequency\\'. 67\\\\t_y\", \\'^f s 4 single-stage i iyput

causes a llj^iceabie gain reduction. otis gain reduction, however, occurs a decade earlier than the cross-over frequency and dues not cause loop in- stability. if an input filter is designed with a controlled 7.p(s) peaking lees than 20% of the negative impedance ji2rl, and the input filter resonant frequency w  is much less than 1/3 of the switching frequeny, the ;input filter related loop

technology assessment, technology development and, commercialization. the status of each of these project areas will be discussed in succeeding sec- tions of this paper, ending with an overall project summary. 0\\', \"technology assessment propulsion technology assessments have been undertaken for two pur- poses. first, to provide component performance data to current electric and hybrid vehicle (ehv) manufacturers which will assist them in selecting com- ponents for their vehicles. second, to identify important component inter- actions within or resulting from the propulsion system, which influence its design or the design of other components in the vehicle. work is presently under way on motor/controller testing, transmission testing, and studies of the interactions between the propulsion system and traction battery. most vehicles built today use series-a,vund do traction motors with an electronic chopper to control the armature current, and therefore the motor speed. testing at nasa-lewis has shown (2) that a significant interaction exists between this type of motor and controller. figure 1 shows that when a do series moto: is controlled by an armature chopper, the efficiency of the motor is lower when running on chopped current than it is if operated on pure do current for the same power output. this difference in efficiency can he quite significant-as much as 10 percentage points-at part power. since motor catalogs normally give motor performance when operating from a do source, use of catalog data could result in a substantial shortfall in vehicle performance. testing of four different types of commonly used trac- tion motors with several controllers is now being performed for nasa-lewis by the eaton corporation. using a standard sae procedure, the eaton corporation, under a separate contract, has completed tests oil \\\\tsmall automotive transmissions which could be considered for ev use. these were the chevette, pinto, and omni automatics, and the chevrolet luv four-speed manual transmission. tests were performed under conditions which the transmission would see if used in an electric vehicle. typical results for one of the automatic transmissions is shown in fig. 2. these tests show that while these transmissions may reach 90 percent efficiency in a conventional car, they may only operate at up to 80 percent in an ev, due to the fact that the transmission is over- sized for electric vehicle service. selection of a transmission can there- fore significantly effect the range of an ev. individual reports :or each transmission will be written and publishes. testing of a citation automatic is under way. pests are also under way to define the interactions between propulsion systems and batteries. these tests are designed to provide statistically significant data on the effects of chopper controllers and of various load leveling and regeneration systems oil \\\\tenergy capacity and cycle life of lead-acid batteries. as with motors, in-house tests have shown that lead-, acid traction batteries ma j suffer er a signifi cant performance loss when dis- charged in a pulsed mode. () further tests being, conducted at \\'trw are designed to quantity the performance of lead-acid batteries as a function of chopper frequency, poak-to-average current ratio and depth-of-discharge. in ra related program, the naval weapons support center at crane, indiana is evaluating the effect of the design that the regenerative braking (energy recovery) system used in the propulsion system has on battery performance and life. the national bureau of standards has started a project supported by the ehv propulsion project to calibrate wideband, high current instrumentation shunts and develop a primary standard instrument for the measurement of power in non-sinusoidal signals. the results of this effort will form a c e\", \"recognized and respected base for calibrating instruments used in the mea- surement of electrical power parameters in electric vehicle propulsion sys- tems. power transistors are a critical element in a growing number of propul- sion systems. a continuing assessment of their availability and applicabil- ity to ev propulsion systems is being maintained. a grant to virginia polytechnic institute has been initiated to perform detailed evaluations of presently available and new power transistors. man; commercially available components presently exist which could be used in electric and hybrid propulsion systems. however, there is no read- ily available means for system designers to identify or locate them. there- fore, a contract was recently signed with the chilton company to assemble and publish a catalog of components for electric vehicle propulsion sys- tems. this catalog will be in the form of an assembly of short form cata- logs or data sheets from individual suppliers. requests for inputs to the catalog have been sent to over 4000 potential suppliers. this catalog should be published in early 1981. catalog publication will be announced itstar and will be available through ntis. technology development a variety of technology development projects are under way which seek to develop propulsion components and systems which will improve the- perfor- mance and efficiency of electric and hybrid vehicles and reduce their cost to the consumer. the work is divided into two levels of technology; the first io intended to support commercialization of ehv\\'s in the mid-1980\\'x, and the second, which is more advanced, could support vehicles which might be produced in the early 1990\\'s and beyond. it is recognized that no single approach will be best for the broad range of potential vel.icle missions and that many potentially good solutions to a particular need exist. therefore, in the first stages of most developments, multiple parallel contracts are being pursued. as development efforts progress, the number of supported approaches will be narrowed to those with the greatest commercial potential for low cost and attractive performance. figure 3 shows five different traction motors which are presently under development. the improved motors are examples of what existing technology ,_\\\\xadi offer. both are permanent magnet cylindrical rotor motors which require no external source of field excitation and use --emiconductor power switches to replace the brush-commutator of conventional do motors. speed control is achieved within the electronic commutation and control circuits. the motors have been designed to provide sufficient torque and speed to drive a nominal 1600 kg vehicle over the sae j227a schedule d driving profile and to attain a constant 55 mph. one gear ratio change is allowed and regeneration is re- quired. the two contractors used different approaches in achieving the goals. the airesearch approach in fig. 3(a) uses a small (16 kg) high-speed (26 000 rpm) motor, power transistors, and industrial thyristors. the virginia polytechnic institute and state university approach in fig. 3(b), uses a larger (40 kg), medium speed (9000 rpm) motor and high power transis- tors. inland motor, a leader in the manufacture of permanent magnet moors, under subcontract to vpissu, designed and built the electric machinery por- tion of their motor. both contractors successfully built and tested func- tional models of their respective concepts in late fy 1979 and engineering models will begin testing in early fy 1981. 3\", \"the advanced motor designs shown in the lower half of fig. 3 emphasize approaches which are expected to lead to significant cost reductions in mass production. three parallel developments for advanced propulsion motors are under way. the contractors for these are: garrett-airesearch (3c), general elec- tric (3d) , and westinghouse (3e) . the airesearch and general electric motors use permanent magnets and electronic commutation. the westinghouse motor has an electromagnetically excited field and a mechanical commutator. all three are disk type motors. the airesearch approach uses a single high energy samarium-cobalt mag- net and operates at a maximum speed of 14 000 rpm from a battery voltage of 240 volts. the first functional model of the airesearch motor demonstrated mechanical integrity and electromagnetic feasibility, but excessi ,.e windage and eddy current losses indicated a need for more development. the func- tional model is being modified to correct or minimize these problems. because of its simplicity, this type of motor has high potential for low cost. the efficiency goal is 90 percent averaged over the sae j227a schedule d profile. this motor is expected to weight approximately 19 kg without electronics, which are expected to weigh an additional 40 kg. the general electric motor uses multiple magnets. a new permanent mag- net material, manganese-aluminum-cobalt (mn-al-c), was intended to be used in this motor but is not yet available in sufficient quantity to build an operating machine. therefore, the motor cum ntly uses alnico magnets. mechanical integrity and functional performance were demonstrated, but the magnet strength was not adequate for full rated performance as predicted. mn-al-c magnets are becoming more readily available and consideration is being given to modifying the present model to achieve predicted perfor- mance. the final motor will weigh about 42 kg without electronics, which are expected to weigh about 40 kg. the efficiency goal is 90 percent aver- aged over the driving profile. because of the simplicity and use of low cost magnets, this motor also has potential for low cost. westinghouse has completed and successfully tested the functional model of their motor. the torroidally wound motor can also lead to low production costs. the functional model test data indicates an efficiency of approxi- mately 90 percent or more over a major portion of the operating range. the finished motor is expected to weight of approximately 59 kg. westinghouse is now proceeding to design, build, and test an engineering model based on the principles developed with the functional model. preliminary design cal- culations for the engineering model predict a weight of approximately 45 kg, a maximum speed of i200 rpm, and an efficiency about the same as the func- tional model. figure 4 summarizes the characteristics and efficiency of the various designs tested to date and compares it with the contractors\\' pre- dicted performance. although induction motors offer the potential of low cost and small size, present controllers for induction motors are large and costly. in parallel contacts, general electric and gould have developed engineering models of induction motor controllers designed for the same vehicle perfor- mance as the electronically commutated motors. the general electric ap- proach uses transistors similar to those used in the department of energy\\'s near-term electric vehicle controller and the gould approach uses readily available low cost thvristors. figure: 5 shows the gould controller along with the associated induction motor. this motor is a modified conventional three-phase design. the ge controller is similar in size to the gould con- troller. both were designed for easy accessibility and serviceability and s\\\\t 4\", \"weigh approximately 69 kg each. in a final design for automotive use, they would be noticeably smaller and lighter. test results on the gould con- troller indicate efficiencies of above 85 percent over a major portion of the opt-rating range. the efficiency of the ge controller is somewhat higher, reaching 95 percent. this difference was expected since scr\\'s and their commutating circuitry have more losses than transistors, which have a lower forward voltage drop and do not need commutation circuitry. tests on the gould controller are complete and the units will be shipped to nasa- lewis for further evaluation. contractor tests of the ge controller are nearing completion. these component developments have been described in several technical papers and fi nal reports on the developments will be pre- pared. it is recognized that do commutator motors may be used in electric vehicles well into the late 1980 time frame. therefore, two advanced do controllers for such motors have been under development. one is by franklin research center and the other by chrysler. franklin has designed a con- troller which uses a rotating motor--generator set in buck-boost modes to control the traction motor. this approach lends itself to simplicity and easy maintenance and does not use high power switching transistors or scr\\'s. the franklin approach has been proven in principle, and engineering model design calculations indicate a workable, rugged controller can be built with a predicted weight of 64 kg and an efficiency greater than 80 percent over about one half of the operating range. however, it is heavier and less efficient than competing approaches which may outweigh the advantage of this controller design. the chrysler controller uses power switching transistors operating at 10 kilohertz and above. a notable feature of this controller is the very low audible noise level as a result of the high frequency operation. chrysler has successfully built and is testing a full-rated functional model (shown in fig. 6) which weighs approximately 27 kg. test results indicate an efficiency of approximately 95 percent over a very wide operating range. further development of this controller is planned. a need for continuously variable transmission (cvt\\'s) is anticipated for electric and hybrid vehicles, especially for those with flywheels. development of such transmissions began with four parallel design studies which were completed in fy 1980. garrett-airesearch designed a torroidal variable ratio traction concept and bales-mccoin a traction cone/roller arrangement. battelle columbus laboratories designed a variable ratio pulley, compression, steel v-belt transmission and emerson kumm a variable ratio pulley flat belt transmission. predicted weights for these cvt\\'s are 41 to 70 kg and nominal full load efficiencies are 88 to 96 percent. reports on these studies are being published. while much emphasis is placed on propulsion components, total system development is not being neglected. in march 1979 a cost-sharing contract was started with the eaton corporation to develop an electric vehicle pro- pulsion system using a two-speed automatically shifted transaxle, a three- phase transistorized power inverter, and a logic controller incorporating a microprocessor. the motor is rated at 25 horsepower. the computer con- troller supplied with the system is designed for maximum flexibility in that the pulse shaping logic can be adjusted to optimize system efficiency. the components and the complete system have been tested on dynamometers. a model of the system is shown in fig. 7. the test results are extremely promising, indicating maximum system eff iciet.cies over 80 percent at equiva- lent vehicle speeds of 40 to 60 mph. the system tests were completed at i,\\\\t 5\", \\'eaton in august 1980 and the system shipped to nasa -lewis where it will be tested under simulated driving conditions on the road load simulator (rls). negotiations are under way with eaton to further develop the ac propulsion system and to incorporate it into test vehicles. propulsion system r&d related specifically to hybrid vehicles has thus far been limited to system studies and the development of computer analyti- cal techniques and programs. three studies to analytically evaluate hybrid propulsion systems have been completed. the work was performed by garrett corporation-airesearch manufacturing company, mechanical technology incorporated (mti), and south coast technology (sct). the studies showed that hybrid propulsion systems can significantly reduce petroleum consumption while still providing a vehicle having acceptable cost and performance. propulsion systems with conventional heat engines, stirling heat engines, and rotary heat engines were investigated. the studies oh: wed that hybrids with any of these engine types demonstrated good fuel economy and good performance providing they operated in an on-off heat engine mode. in order to achieve acceptable efficiency, all three studies concluded that the heat engine and electric motor must be operated in parallel as shown on fig. 8. in this mode, most of the stop-and-go urban driving used electric power and the heat engine is turned on only when needed for power requirements in excess of the electric system ca pability. for long trips, when the battery could be depleted, the vehicle cruises on heat engine power and the electric system provides only peaking power. characteristics and fuel consumption of the propulsion sys- tems in typical passenger cars are summarized in fig. 9. the \"simwest \" computer simulation program originslly developed by the boeing company for analysis of wind energy systems is being modified under contract by boeing so it can be used to simulate complex hybrid and electric vehicle propulsion systems. the program, called heavy, is especially useful in simulating complex operating strategies such as are used in the on-off hybrid systems. the program is now operational on ti,e boeing computer and is being checked out through the simulation of an electric drive (the ge etv-1) and a complex on-off hybrid system. the program is expected to be complete and available for general use in early 1981. commercialization technology development by itself does not constitute completeif \\\\tunless a path can be clearly identified which moves that tech- nology from the laboratory to the market. the ultimate goal of the commer- cialization effort is to stimulate the voluntary involvement of industry in joint ventures with the government to accelerate the early application and market :troduction of commercially viable electric and hybrid propulsion system ind components. for the past 18 months, nasa -lewis has been working with dul to develop a strategy for commercializing ev propulsion components and systems. it was recognized early that industry and not the government must decide what constitutes a viable commercial product, and consultations with indt ►stry were held throughout development of the commercialization plan. the key features of the plan are shown on fig. 10. they are based on the concept of a joint, cost-shared industry-government commercialization venture in which the government would provide the majority of the funding early in a project when the risk is highest, with industry assuming an in- creasingly larger share as the project approaches production. further in- a\\\\t b\\', \\'f centives may be provided to industry ii: the form of special considerations for exclusivity in the patent and data areas. in return the government would receive an appropriate payback of its iuvestment if the project is successful and protection of the taxpayer\\\\\\'s interests. in this way, we hope to stimulate commercialization of propulsion technology two or more years sooner than it might otherwise occur. this plan has been reviewed with doe program and legal staff members and agreement to the approach achieved. the first application of the commercialization approach will be in 1981 w yen we plan to initiate a joint venture with industry to make available a low cost do propulsion system. summary studies conducted by our laboratory (4) and others show that the pro- pulsion system rather than the battery may be the largest contributor to the purchase price of an electric car to the consumer, although the battery will be the major factor in the life-cycle cost. we execpt that propulsion r&d will significantly reduce these costs, lowering the potential vehicle pur- chase price by 20 percent or more. while achieving this goal, the work being conducted will also provide current electric and hybrid vehicle manu- facturers with engineering design data and new components and systems which will assist them in building better vehicles. it will also generate a broader technology base from which future manufazturers can draw in design- inp vehicles for large scale production. and perhaps most importantly, we intend to use creative procurement approaches to stimulate commercialization of propulsion components and systems by industry. bibliography 1.\"state-of-the-art assessment of electric and hybrid vehicles,\" nasa tm-79509, 1978.

technology require the improvement in conversion efficiency of existing systems or the development of technical- ly and economically viable now systems. for energy conversion systems cur- rently in use, such as steam-electric power plants, internal combustion and turbine ongines, the conversion efficiencies, at least in principle, can be improved simply by increasing their temperature of operation. unfortunately, such an approach is not practical at this time. t%ls is because of the lack of availability of suitable materials of construction which can render satisfactory service at high temperatures over the time periods required for economic operation with minimum down-time. the successful development of new energy conversion systems such as mhd, nuclear fusion, etc., to large extent if not completely, will depend on whether appropriate materials of construction for critical components are available or can be develoyed. solar energy represents an attractive alternative among the many new sources for energy cinder consideration at this time, in view of its near unlimited supply. however, for solar energy systems too, the availability of suitable materials of construction will be a major factor whicn will de- cide their technical and economic feasibility. even for solar receivers which operate at relatively low temperatures, such as hot water systems, the durability and reliability of available materials of construction still need to-be established for reliable estimates of technical and economic feasibility of such systems.\\', \\'for solar receivers which ope rite at much higher temperatures, such as steam-electric or hot air-electric system, potential problems to be en- countered with materials are expected to be quite severe. for acceptable conversion efficiencies, such systems may have to operate at temperatures well in excess of 1000 0c. at these temperature levels very few, if any, polymeric or metallic materials will be available to provide satisfactory trouble-free service without frequent replacement. ceramics, for this reason, are the logical (and only) choice of materials of construction. ceramic materials have many favorable properties for high-temperature solar receivers such as high melting point, excellent resistance to creep deformation and high resistance to corrosion and erosion. unfortunately, ceramics, in spite of these favorable properties, also exhibit certain un- desirable characteristics which dictate extreme care in their use. these unfavorable properties include a high degree of brittleness, low to moderate tensile strength and low im pact resistance. due to the brittleness and un- favorable combination of other physical properties, ceramic materials also are highly susceptible to fracture when subjected to constrained thermal expansions due to non-linear temperature distributions or-rapid temperature variations, commonly referred to as \"thermal shock\". such \"thermal shock\" can result in thermal stresses of magnitude well in excess of the failure stress of a ceramic. under these conditions fracture can occur in a catastrophic manner, rendering the structure or component completely incapable of providing con- tinued satisfactory service. this aspect of ceramic materials is particularly critical for high-temperature sol: • receivers which even under norm&! operating conditions will be subjected to rapid temperature variations. this, for in- stance, will occur under weather conditions consisting of intermittent cloud 2\\', \\'f •\\\\t covers, which can cause rapid heating and cooling due to large variations in the intensity of the incident radiant heat flux. it is the view of the writers of this report that the feasibility of solar receivers made of ceramic materials will critically depend on their ability to withstand the thermal stresses resulting from rapid temperature variation. the possibility of catastrophic failurr due to such thermal stresses should be considered in the very preliminary design stages of such solar receivers. furthermore, materials of construction should be chosen very carefully to reduce the probability of thermal stress failure to an absolute minimum. in order to do so, it is imperative that the fac- tors which affect the thermal stress fracture behavior of brittle ceramics ave well understood. the objective of the present study is to review the current under- standing of the factors which govern the failure of brittle ceramics under conditions which generate thermal stresses of high magnitude. this review will provide a general framework for the selection of ceramic materials for solar-energy receivers and associated components with maximum resistance to thermal stress failure. 1.2. scope of study in order to render the results of this study as generally useful as possible. the discussion to be presented will not be design -spf.  fic. never- theless, a few recommendations will be made appropriate to point- focus solar receivers for which a number of general design features have been developed and for which a number of specific designs are underway. no attempt will be made to develop the basis for thermo-elastic theory, the 3\\', \\'principles of heat transfer or the various aspects of materials science and engineering. for these, a vast literature is available. the role of the various material properties and specifically their inter- action as currently available from the literature, will receive major emphasis. recommendations for further analytical work, material development and physical prcperty measurement appropriate to the thermal stress failure is solar re- ceivers will be made. a number of general design and operating principles which will reduce the incidence of thermal stress fracture of individual com- ponents, will be outlined. for convenience to the reader, the technical discussion of this report will be subdivided into individual sections as follows: a.general

minimize the theoretical and experimental details. whenever appropriate, reprints of the particular literature studies cited, will be included in the report in the form of appendices. s t\\', \\'2. material properties and other variables which affect the thermal stress failure of brittle ceramics: general outline. in order to establish a framework for the selection of ceramic materials for solar receivers with optimum thermal shock resistance, a general dis- cussion of the material properties and external variables which affect the thermal stress failure of such materials will be presented first. most conveniently, this can be done by considering thermal stress failure to be result of four independent successive phenomena or stages as follows: a.generation of temperature distributions. b.generation of thermal stresses as the result of temperature dis- tributions. c.the onset of failure due to thermal stresses of high magnitude. d.the formation of cracks as the result of failure and their effect on subsequent performance. each of these stages is controlled by a unique set of material properties and other variables, to be discussed individually in the following section. 2.1. variables which control temperature distributions temperature changes in a structure are the result of heat conduction through its surface (either inward ar outward) or as the result of internal heat generation. heat transfer by conduction within the solid is controlled by thermal conductivity and diffusivity of the material. such heat transfer can occur in a steady-state or transient mode. heat can be transported to or from the surface by convection or radiation or a combination of both. a large body of literature is available on convective and radiative heat transfer. convective heat transfer generally is a function of the 6\\', \"properties of the medium surrounding the structure, the geometry of the structure as well as the temperature difference between the structure and the medium. convective heat transfer, generally, is not a function of the properties of the material being heated, with the possible excep- tion of heat transfer involving nucleate boiling which may be a function of the surface roughness. radiative heat transfer on the other nand, in addition to geometric effects, is a function of the optical properties of the material including the reflectivity, absorptivity, emissivity and the absorption coefficient for transmitted radiation. it is important to note that these optical pro- perties are a function of wave-length, temperature, surface condition (finish) and angle of incidence for the incident radiation. 2.2. materials properties which control the magnitude of thermal stress from a known temperature distribution, the resulting thermal stresses can be calculated. it is important to point out that such a calculation requires only the distribution of the temperature, without knowing specifi- cally how this temperature distribution was achieved. a distribution of temperature causes an equivalent distribution of thermal strains directly proportional to the coefficient of thermal ex- pansion. thermal stresses arise when the thermal expansions cannot occur freely as the result of external or internal constraints. for linearly elastic solids, the thermal stresses are directly proportional to young\\'s modulus of elasticity, and frequently are a function of poisson\\'s ratio as well. plastic deformation such as by dislocation mechanisms in metallic materials can help reduce the magnitude of the thermal stresses appreciably. 7\", \\'however, plasticity is generally very limited in ceramic materials for _.\\\\t solar receivers at normal operating temperatures. at sufficiently high temperatures, however, thermal stress relaxation in ceramics can occur by diffusional creep. for creep rates directly proportional to the stress (i.e., linear creep), the rate of thermal stress relaxation can be described by a stress-independent \"viscosity\" term. it appears ap- propriate at this time to point out that thermal stress relaxation by creep or any other type of non-linear deformation may not be desirable. on bringing the structure to thermal equilibrium at ambient temperature, such thermal stress relaxation could result in levels of residual stress of sufficient magnitude that catastrophic failure could occur. 2.3. materials properties which control failure under the influence of thermal stresses for an assessment of the properties which affect thermal stresu failure, three failure modes must be considered. a.rapid fracture b.fat_ .,at failure c.thermal buckling rapid fracture occurs when the thermal stresses exceed the failure stress of the material. in brittle materials, such failure usually occurs in tension, because of the high ratio of compressive to tensile strength. nevertheless, failure under the influence of compressive stresses cannot be ruled out, especially those due to external constraints. brittle materials generally fail from pre-existing cracks. a knowledge of the crack size and geometry as well as the appropriate thermal stress intensity factor, will permit an assessment of rapid failure in terms of the critical 8\\', \\'stress intensity factors for the materials under consideret{.on. for tensile or shear failure (or their combinations), this will involve the critical stress intensity factors, kid, kiic and kiiic for mode i, mode ii, and mode iii of the crack opening displacement, respectively. fatigue failure occurs as the result of sub-critical crack growth at steady-state or cyclic stress levels below those required for fast fracture. at temperatures near room temperature, such crack growth fr:quently occurs due to a \"stress-corrosion\" reaction, or is accelerated by the presence of surface-active molecules. in particular, water appears to be very effective in this respect. at high temperatures where the rate of the surface, grain boundary or bulk diffusion becomes appreciable, subcritical crack growth can occur by diffusional phenomena. in principle, as discussed in detail in a subsequent section, the fatigue-life in terms of time or cycles to failure can be calculated if data on the kinetics of subcritical crack growth are available. a common expression (among many others) to describe the rate of crack growth, v is given by: v • aki exp (-q/rt)\\\\t (2.3.1) where a and n are numerical constants, k i is the stress intensity factor and q is the activation energy for the process reponsible for the crack growth. therefore, calculations of fatigue .life for a given material require values of a, n and q. thermal buckling, to be described in further detail later, also repre- sents a failure mechanism which should be considered in the design of ceramic solar receivers. thermal buckling occurs as the result of the mechanical instability of relatively slender structures which are prevented 9\\', \"k from expanding against rigid constraints or cooler parts of the structure. thermal buckling can result in major bending deformations of the struc- tures, which depending on the conditions of constraint can serve as a mechanism of thermal stress relief. on the other hand, the bending stresses induced by such deformations could result in a tensile fracture. as will be shown later, thermal buckling and subsequent possiblt. fracture depends on the coefficient of thermal expansion, young\\'s modulus, tensile strength or critical stress intensity factor and in some cases on the thermal conductivity as well. 2.4. material properties which control crack propagation following the fracture of brittle ceramics by thermal stresses crack propagation following the onset of fracture in brittle ceramics under the influence of thermal stresses can be quite extensive. for this reason, materials selection and design for high-temperature structures is based on promoting rapid crack arrest, rather than avoiding thermal stress fracture altogether, a goal not easily achieved. a design philosophy based on crack arrest requires data on the behavior of crack propagation. the extent of dynamic (unstable) crack propagation, commonly en- countered in high-strength ceramics is governed by the elastic energy at fracture, the energy expended in propagating a crack per \\'init area of crack surface, y f, as well as the total nu°aber of cracks participating in the fracture process. the elastic energy at fracture is governed by the young\\'s modulus, poisson\\'s ratio, and the failure stress such as the tensile strength. stable crack propagation in thermal stress fields is controlled by the coefficient of thermal expansion, young\\'s modulus, poisson\\'s ratio 10 0\", \\'as well as the fracture surface energy. at this point it is important to mention that the fracture surface energy can also be derived from the critical stress intensity factor, t-1c. however, it should be noted that the values of yf or kc for the initia- tion of fracture may not be identical to the corresponding values observed for the crack propagation or arrest. finally, the inertial effects of crack propagation will be assumed to be small for the thermal stress fracture of solar receivers and hence the sound velocity will not be considered as a design parameter. 2.5. summary for convenience of the reader,

development of selecti01r rules for ceramic materials with optimum thermal. stress resistance in order to establish the basic framework for the development of selection rules for ceramics with optimum thermal stress resistance, a discussion is in order to the basic definition of how such thermal stress resistance is defined. for this purpose,it is important to recognize that in the technical community engaged in high-temperature technology, two radically different philosophies have evolved for the designation of ther- mal stress (or shock) resistance. as will be demonstrated in subsequent sections of this report, failure to appreciate the basic difference in philosophies could lead to major errors in the selection of the appropriate materials, which in turn could lead to spectacular catastrophic failures. 3.1. material selection based on the avoidance of therma? stress fracture. the first of the two philosophies referred to above is based on the concept that the thermal stresses be kept sufficiently low that thermal stress failure is not initiated. in other words, the magnitude of thermal stress (or stress intensity factor) is always less than the failure stress (or critical stress intensity factor) of the component or structure. of course, this philosophy is not unique to high-temperature technology and is universally accepted in the fields of mechanical, civil and other engi- neering involved in structural design. for brittle ceramics, this design philosophy is appropriate (if not essential) to structures or components for which the performance would be adversely effected by the formation of cracks. this would be so particularlyl 13\\', \\'for load-bearing structures subjected to tensile or bending stresses such as turbine blades. also, this philosophy would apply to such items required to maintain atmosphere or pressure control such as automotive spark-plugs, heat exchangers, seals, etc. thermal stress resistance of the materials, from which such components are made is defined in terms of the maximum temperature difference, the maximum radiant heat flux, the maximum rate of heating and other similar criteria such that the maximum thermal stress does not exceed the design strength of the material at any instant during the time period over which the material is subjected to thermal stress. the first step in developing the selection rules for ceramic material with optimum thermal stress resistance as defined by this philosophy, is to obtain information on the temperature distribution for a given thermal environment. this information can be obtained theoretically for the known heating/cooling conditions or can be obtained experimentally. in this respect, it should be noted that particularly for complex geometries, calculations of temperature distributions in a structure from basic prin- ciples of heat transfer still can be rather uncertain. spatially non- uniform heating and cooling and mixed radiative and convective heat trans- fer introduce further complexities. the reliability of calculated tem- perature distribution is expected to be no better than the assumptions made. also, any uncertainties in the temperature distributions will be reflected in the calculated thermal stresses. for this reason, it is strongly recommended that any proto-typs solar receiver be instrumented as completely as practically possible to obtain experimental data on the temperature distribution. these data can constitute a more reliable basis for the evaluation of the thermal stresses than calculated temperature 14\\', \\'distributions based on simplified assumptions. an additional bene- fit in obtaining experimental data for the temperature is that a comparison can be made with the calculated data for the validity of the original assump- tions on heat transfer conditions. the resulting feed-back will be a major value in the assessment and interpretation of possible thermal stress failures in solar receivers. the next step is to evaluate the thermal stresses from the tempera- ture distributions. this can be done by analytical or numerical methods. analytical methods have the disadvantage that they are limited to relatively simple geometries, spati-illy uniform heat transfer and material properties which are independent o: temperature. a major advantage of the analytical method is that it results in analytical expressions for the thermal stresses in which the contributory role of the relevant material properties, heat transfer mechanisms, geometry, etc. are clearly defined. numerical methods, such as finite element analysis are more con- venient to real-life structures of complex geometry, spatial non-uniform heat transfer and temperature dependent properties. the disadvantage of the numerical method is that it provides a numerical answer for the stresses with little or no direct information of the relative role of individual material properties and other variables which affect the magnitude of the thermal stresses. for this reason, numerical methods are less convenient for the derivaticn of general selection rules for materials with high thermal stress resistance. of course, finite element anzlysix, for instance, is a highly valuable tool for the optimization of a given design. since the primary purpose of this study is to identify and analyze the individual fatter: which affect thermal stress resistance, this report will emphasize selection rules obtained by the analytical approach. 15\\', \\'the third step in deriving the selection rules is to define a failure criterion. for instance, the magnitude of thermal stress should not ex- ceed some specified value of stress, such as the tensile strength. or some minimum value of thermal fatigue-life or cycles may be defined. other criteria may be appropriate to failure by thermal buckling. the fourth stop in obtaining selection rules for materials with high thermal stress resistance is to substitute the failure criterion into the appropriate equation for the thermal stresses. rearrangement of this equation will result in exr-assions for the maximum rate of heating, tem- perature difference, incident radiant has t flux, thermal fatigue-life, etc., to which the structure and component can be subjected without incurring the risk of thermal stress failure. as will be demonitrated, these expressions clearly define the individual effects of the relevant material properties, geometry and dimensions which affect the thermal stress resistance. for a given thermal environment, geometry and defined failure criterion, these expressions will yield so-called thermal stress resistance \"parameters\" or \"figures-of-merit\" on the basis of which the optimum material can be selected. this report will review all such expressions which have appeared in the technical literature for a wide variety of thermal conditions and failure criteria. since a change in geometry involves a change in the numerical value of the geoms::-ic constant, for rurposes of efficiency, redundancy can be avoided in presenting the equation for a given thermal environment for a single geometry only. further redundancy is avoided by presenting tae equations, whenever appropriate, in terms of the maximum thermal stress value (such as the tensile strength) to which the material can be subjected. for materials with cracks of known size and geometry, 16 r\\', \\'the equations can be expressed in terms of the critical stress intensity factor by simple substitution of the relationship between this latter quantity and the fractut. stress. 3.2. material selection based on limited crack propagation frequently, in high-temperature str•ctures, the magnitude of thar.:r 1 stress can be so high that even in the materials with the highest thermal stress resistance, as defined in the previous section, failure cannot be avoided. this situation is common in such structures as various furnaces and crucibles in the metal working industry, various kilns, thermal stor- age systems, casting nozzles and similar applications. under such condi- tions, material selection based on the avoidance of fracture as discussed previously, simply is not relevant. instead, material selection and design is based on the philosophy that the extent of crack propagation which re- sults from thermal stress failure is kept to a minimum. in this manner, the relevant material properties are affected as little as possible. also, the material will retain its geometry and will continue to provide satis- factory service !n spite of being in a partially fractured condition. this philosophy is applied almost exclusively to materials used in the \"re- fractories\" industry. the methods of testing of the thermal stress resistance of such materials also reflect this philosophy. instead of measuring the maximum heat flux, rate of heating, etc., required for failurr:, as would be done to establish thermal stress resistance based on the avoidance of thermal fracture. refractories are tested in a different manner. such testing consists of subjecting the material to a very severe thermal en- vironment such as i-ionching with a high heat transfer coefficient followed by measuring the effect of the resulting failure on the properties or dimen- 17\\', \\'sions of the material. for instance, a measure of thermal stress resistance may be based on the weight lost by the material per unit area due to the complete loss of fragments from the surface. alternatively, the number of cycles may be measured required for propagation of a crack complete:y through the material. a favorite method is to measure the tensile (bend) strength retained by the material following the thermal shock. in terms of the latter test, the criterion for good thermal stress resistance is br.eed on the maximum retention of strength. the development of selection rules for high thermal stress resistance for limited crack propagation must be based on an analysis of crack pro- pagation behavior in thermal stress fields. it should be noted that the theory of crack propagation under thermal stresses is relatively unexplored and is a fruitful area for future work. nevertheless, for simple mechani- cal models, a number of selection rules have been developed to be presented in further detail later together with experimental evidence in support of these rules. as will be expected and demonstrated, the selection rules for the avoidance of thermal fracture differ significantly from those ap- propriate for material selection based on limited crack propagation. 18 w\\', \\'4. development of selection rules for brittle ceramics with optimum thermal stress resistance this section will .. ,centrate on presenting an overview of the analytical results for the thermal stresses for a variety of heat transfer conditions and.modes of failure. appropriate selection r.les for ceramics with maximum thermal stress resistance will be developed. valess stated, the pertinent material properties will be assumed t: be independent of temperature. through- out the discussion, the material will be assumed to behave as a continuum. for grossly heterogeneous strictures or composite materials, the results ob- tained may require modification. for instance, caution is advised with regard to selecting values of the fracture stress. c!nce in composite mate- rials with thermal and elastic discontinuities, the thermal stress concen- tration factors are expected to differ from those under conditions of mechani- cal loading, the thermal stress may not necessarily be equal to the mechanical failure stress. 4.1. steady-state heat flow or isothermal conditions 4.1.1. flat plate. absence of external constraints the flat plate is located in the y,z-plane and - a = x `- a and is sub- jected to steady-state heat flow in the x-direction. the thermal conducti- vity is independent of temperature and position. this condition results in a linear temperature distribution of the form: t - to+vx\\\\t(4.1.1.1) where g is the temperature gradient. the temperature difference, at, across the plate in the x-direction becomes at - 2a0. 19\\', \\'for an unconstrained flat plate,the stresses can be computed from: ay^z a le l- t + i. ja tdx + 3x2 f  txdx^ \\\\t (4.1.1.2) -a\\\\t2a -s substitution of eq. 4.1.1.1 into eq. 4.1.1. 2 results in: a\\\\ta 0\\\\t (4.1.1.3) y,z as shown by boley and weiner (1960),this result can be shown to be generally valid for any geometry and temperature distribution which is linear in a rectangular coordinate system (even in three dimensions) as long as the body is free from external constaints. at first sight, the above result may appear trivial. nevertheless, it is critical to the understanding of how thermal stresses-arise and how the magnitude of such stresses for any design configuration can be minimized. first of all, the result of eq. 4.1.1.3 shows that the existence of a tem- perature difference within a structure is not a sufficient condition for the existence of thermal stresses. the key-element for the development of thermal stresses is the existence of constraints, either external or inter- nal, which prevent free thermal expansion. the stress-free condition of the above flat plate with linear temperature distribution results from the ab- sence of external constraint so that the non-uniform thermal expansion can be accommodated by bending of the plate. for & linear -temperature gradient, the distribution of the thermal expansions are exactly equal to the dis- placements in the plane of the plate due to the bending. under these con- ditions,the plate is free to deform to a uniform radius of curvature, r given by: r - (7a)-1\\\\t (4.1.1..4) 20 s\\', \\'if in the above plate under steady-state heat flow, the temperature distribution were non-linear as the result of a spatially or temperature dependent thermal conductivity, the stresses no longer will be zero. in general, in unconstrained materials the magnitude of thermal stress is a function of the non-linearity of the temperature distribution. 4.1.2. flat plate. constrained to prevent bending deformations this flat plate has the identical boundary conditions as those in section 4.1.1, but with the additional constraint that bending deformations are prevented. the linear temperature distribution in this plate will result in a bending moment of such a magnitude that when applied on a free plate will result in a radius of curvature of opposite sign of the curvature of eq. 4.1.1.4. the maximum stress which result from this bend- ing moment equals: oy,z m 0.5 m sot/(1-v) \\\\t (4.1.2.1) the result of eq. 4.1.2.1 can be used to develop a selection rule for materials with optimum thermal stress resistance subjected to steady- state heat flow and constrained from deformation in bending. brittle ceramics generally exhibit values of tensile strength which are some order of magnitude lower than the compressive strength in the above plate con- strained from bending, the magnitude of tensile stress equals the magnitide of compressive stress. for this reason, failure most likely is to occur in tension. the designer is interested in the maximum temperature difference (at max ) or maximum heat flux (g max) to which the constrained flat plate can be subjected. an upper limit on at maxor q.x can be obtained by setting the value of the stress in eq. 4.1.2.1 equal to the tensile strength, which 21\\', \\'upon rearrangement yields: at max- 2 st(1-v)/me\\\\t (4.1.2.2) note that at max is independent of the thickness of the plate. this effect arises because a thicker plate would require a smaller value of temperature gradient 0 (and a corresponding smaller value of induced cur- vature in the unconstrained form) to achieve a given value of at. an expression for the maximum heat flux (per unit area), q =x, can be obtained by noting that the heat flux can be related to at by: q - kat/2a \\\\t (4.1.2.3) where k is the thermal conductivity. substitution of eq. 4.1.2.3 into eq. 4.1.2.2 yields: gmax m st(1-v)k/a ea \\\\t 0\\\\t (4.1.2.4) note that gmax is inversely proportional to the plate thickness. it should also be noted that the derivation of the above expressions for at max and gmax assumes a safety factor equal to unity. this assumption will be made throughout the rest of this report. clearly, because of statistical reasons and uncertainties in the degree of constraints imposed and many other design-related reasons, safety factors in excess of unity may well be preferred in order to insure high reliability. examination of eqs. 4.1.2.2 and 4.1.2.4 shows that the expressions for at max and gmax include a geometric constant (which depends on the degree of constraint), a size factor and a number of material properties. for a given constraint and plate size, the materials engineer or designer can achieve increases in at x or gmax only by optimization of the relevantma material properties. accordingly, atmax can be optimized by maximizing w\\\\t22\\', \\'the \"thermal stress resistance parameter\" or \"figure-of-merit\" given by: st(1-v)/a e\\\\t (4.1.2.5) similarly, gmax can be optimized by maximizing the parameter: st(1-v)k/a e \\\\t (4.1.2.6) 4.1.3. flat plate at uniform temperature, constrained from in-plane expansion this flat plate located in the y,z-plane is at uniform temperature, but prevented from thermal expansion by rigid constraints at the edges of the plate. the plate will be considered to be sufficiently thick so that failure due to elastic instabil\\\\\\'.ty (i.e. thermal buckling) is avoided. this mode of failure will be discussed later in this report. the stresses in the plate due to a uniform temperature rise at are: ay1z • - aeot/(1-v)\\\\t (4.1.3.1) for materials with a positive coefficient of thermal expansion, as is the case with most materials, the stresses in the plate are compressive. at sufficiently high values of ot, the material in the plate could fail in a compressive mode. the maximum value of temperature difference, at max , by which the plate can be heated, without incurring compressive failure can be derived by setting the stress in eq. 4.1.3.1 equal to the compressive strength, sc, which yields: max a sc(1-v)/ae\\\\t(4.1.3.2) with a corresponding thermal stress resistance parameter identical to the above expression. 23\\', \\'4.1.4. composite structures high levels of thermal stress even under isothermal conditions can be generated in composites and structures composed of strongly bonded dissimilar materia_: with mismatches in their coefficients of thermal expansion. such a composite or structure will be stress-free only at the temperature at which the materials which constitute the composite or structure were fabricated or joined. a change from this value of temperature creates thermal stress, as each individual material is prevented from free expansion by the other material(s). such stresses usually are undesirable, with the possible exception of the bi-metallic strip for which the resulting deformation can be used to advantage to the operation of a thermostat. a simple expression can be given for the stresses which result from a mismatch in the coefficients of thermal expansion for a composite struc- ture consisting of a thin coating on an underlying thick substrate. the magnitude of the stresses in the coating equals: o - eamat/(1-v) \\\\t (4.1.4.1) where am is the difference in the coefficients of thermal expansion of the substrate and the coating and at is the difference in temperature at which the coating was joined to the substrate and the new temperature to which the composite is heated or cooled. for other composite structures such as inclusions (eshelby, 1961; selsing, 196 1.;t and concentric rings or cylinders, the expressions for the stresses which result from a mismatch in the coefficients of thermal expansion, are more comr-ilex and involve the elastic properties of all individual components or materials. regardless of the geometry, however, the magnitude of these stresses is proportional 24 i.\\', \\'to the quantities aa and at. for this reason, the magnitude of these stress- as can be kept to a minimum by choosing as and at as low as possible. examination of eq. 4.1.4.1 shows that the stresses can be positive or negative depending on the sign of aa and at. for this reason, these stresses can be used to advantage by placing the weakest component in a state of compression by means of a judicious choice of the value (and sign) of aa. 4.1.5. cencentric hollow cylinder. radially outward heat flow the concentric hollow cylinder infinite in extent with inner and outer radius of a and b, respectively, is subjected to radially outward heat flow. this results in a radial distribution of temperature with a temperature difference at between the inner and outer surfaces. the cylinder is not constrained externally. thermal stresses will arise from \"\\\\\\'internal\" constrainst because the cooler and hotter sections in the cylinder prevent one another from

derived. it is important to mention that for radially inward heat flow, the magnitude of the tensile stress exceeds the corresponding value for radially outward heat flow (hasselman and youngblood, 1978). the values for at maxand gmax are correspondingly reduced. this indicates that for hollow cylinders, such as those found in heat exchangers made from brittle ceramics and prone to failure in tension, radially outward heat flow is preferred whenever practical. from a structural point of view, the results of the present section also indicate that under steady-state heat flow and isothermal conditions, the magnitude of thermal stresses can be reduced by promoting free thermal expansion, by avoiding external constraints, whenever practical. •\\\\t4.1.6 uniform internal heat generation thermal stresses of high magnitude can be caused by the non-uniform temperature distributions resulting from internal heat generation. this occurs for instance in such components as nuclear fuel elements, in materials subjected to micro-wave heating or materials undergoing a chemical decom- position with a negative heat of reaction. in solar collectors, internal absorption of incident solar radiation also represents a form of internal heat generation. this latter topic, in view of its relevance to solar col- lectors is treated in a separate extensive section of this report. for steady-state, spatially uniform internal heat generation, the role of material properties can be obtained from the solutions for a solid circular cylinder (thermal stress techniques in nuclear industry, 1965). the maximum tensile stress is:\\\\t o - a ehb 2/8(1-v)k \\\\t (4.1.6.1) 27\\', \\'where h is the rate of internal heat generation per unit volume and b is the cylinder radius. eq. 4.1.6.1 can be rearranged to yield the maximum rate of internal heat generation, which can be tolerated without risking tensile thermal stress fracture: hmax - 83 t (1-v)k/meb 2\\\\t (4.1.6.2) eq. 4.1.6.2 indicates that materials which can withstand high rates of internal heat generation should have high values of the thermal stress resistance parameter: st(1-v)k/a e\\\\t(4.1.6.3) eq. 4.1.6.2 also suggests that in order to reduce the possibility of tensile thermal fracture, the cylinder radius should be kept as small as possible. 4.1.7. thermal discontinuities steady-state heat flow in materials with a linear temperature distri- bution and absence of external constraints, as related earlier, will result in zero thermal stress. if, however, such materials contain inclusion with heat conduction properties different from the matrix materials, the tempera- ture field near these inclusions will be disturbed to be non-linear. this, as indicated by florence and goodier (1959) for a spherical cavity and by tauchert (1968) for a general inclusion, will result in a thermal stress field in the immediate vicinity around the inclusion. for the spherical cavity, which represents an extreme case, the magni- tude of the maximum tensile stress is: a - o.sae9b/(1-v) \\\\t (4.1.7.1) where 9 is the temperature gradient in the absence of the cavity and b is the cavity radius. 26\\', \\'eq. 4.1.7.1 can be rearranged to give the maximum temperature gradient, 7max which can be imposed without incurring the risk of tensile failure, which yields: vmax a 2st(1-v)/a eb \\\\t (4.1.7.2) eq. 4.1.7.2 can be rewritten to yield the maximum heat flux given by: gmax • 2st(1-v)k/aeb \\\\t (4.1.7.3) eqs. 4.1.7.2 and 4.1.7.3 show that in order to prevent tensile failure around cavities, materials should be selected with high values of the ther- =1 stress resistance parameters: st(1••v)!ae\\\\tand\\\\tst(1-v)k/ae \\\\t (4.1.7.4) which are identical in form to these derived earlier for other conditions of steady-state heat flow. eqs. 4.1.7.2 and 4.1.7.3 also indicate that if such thermal discontinui- ties are required for functional or other purposes, they be kept as small as possible. 4.2 thermal buckling 4.2.1. general the thermal expansion of structures or components subjected to an increase in temperature can be prevented by external constraints. under these condi- tions, equi-dimensional structures or components will be placed in a state of compression. failure occurs when the compressive stresses exceed the compressive strength, as discussed earlier in section 4.1 of this report. 29\\', \\'for slender columns or plates with a length such greater than their thickness, otzdally (in plane) constrained thermal mansions can be accom- modated by banding deformations, in a direction perpendicular to the direc- tion of constraint. this phenomenon is referred to as thermal buckling. thermal buckling in straight column (and flat plates) is characterized by a thereto-elastic instability consisting of a sudden deflection at a critical temperature difference ot c. it should be noted that bending as the result of a thereto-elast y.: instability does not necessarily involve fracture. fracture in tension may occur during \"post-thermal buckling\" as the result of bending moments induced at temperature differances, at \\\\\\'> qtc. thermo-elastic instability does not occur for slender columns and plates with initial curvature or a curvature due to a transverse temperature gra- dient. nevertheless, such columns or plates can exhibit failure if the ten- sile stresses due to the induced bending momenta exceed the tensile strength. thermal buckling can involve significant changes in geometry, which must be taken into account in the design of any structure or component subject to this mode of deformation. the following sections discuss a number of cases of thermal buckling for which selection rules for materials with high thermal buckling resistance have been derived. 4.2.2. boundary conditions for all thermal buckling cases to be considered, the column will be assumed to have a large length/thickness (i.e., slenderness) ratio, with a uniform cross.-section along the total length. furthermore, the temperatures are assumed to be independent of time and position along the length of the colum. thermal buckling is strongly affected by the nature of the constraints 30\\', \\'parameter can be defined as: a-1(4.2.3.2)which ;+ermit or prevent rotation of the ends of the column. these conditions of constraint will be noted for each case of thermal buckling to be analyzed. 4.2.3. straight columg - uniform temperature - thermo-elastic instability for a straight column with ends free to rotate, fridman (1964), and nurgemeister and stoup (1957) showed that the column remains straight upto a critical temperature difference, at  at which it exhibits instability which is given by: atc - cimji/l2aa\\\\t(4.2.3.1) where i is the cross-sectional moment of inertia, l is the length of the column, a is the coefficient of thermal expansion and a is the cross-sectional area. the value of constant c 1 depends on the boundary conditions and is equal to unity in this case. for a column where the ends are not permitted to rotate the value of c 1 is 4.0 and for a column with one end free and the other end restrained from rotation its value is 0.25. eq. 4.2.3.1 reveals that the critical temperature is an inverse function of the coefficient of thermal expansion a. so a thermal buckl=r..; resistance this parameter controls the critical temperature at c, if the dimensions of the column are constant. to maximize at c, one should choose a material with lowest value of a. if the cross-section of the column is rectangular of width b and depth d, eq. 4.2.3.1 can be written as: at  - c1*2/12n(l/d) 2\\\\t(4.2.3.3) 31\\', \\'from eq. (4.2.3.2) it is clear that the slenderness ratio plays an important role in the buckling phenomenon. the higher the slenderness ratio is, the lower is the critical temperature. columns with very low slenderness ratio (short columns) will normally fail in compression rather than in buckling. 4.2.4. straight column - uniform temperature - post-buckling behavior when th-. temperature rise in a straight column with ends free to rotate, exceeds the zritil.,1 temperature at c, it will not fail im6ediately, but ex- hibits post-thermal buckling analyzed by boley and weiner (1960)1 it will fail only when the maximum bending stresses in the column exceed its tensile strength. under this condition, the maximum temperature difference, ate over which a column with square cross-section can be heated, is given by hasselman, 1979 (appendix 4.2.4.a) ate - at  + st2l2/7r2;me2d2 where st is the tensile strength of the colum. eq. 4.2.4.1 leads to another thermal buckling resistance parameter which is given by: st2/a e2\\\\t(4.2.4.2) again to maximize at max , one should choose a material with high value of st2/a e2. it is important to note that in the second term of eq. 4.2.4.1, the slenderness ratio has an opposite effect to that of the first term given by eq. 4.2.3.3. so high values of at e can be achieved by choosing either very high or low values of l/d. some basic calculations are necessary here to obtain the right value of l/d. 32\\', \\'4.2.5. column with slight initial curvature - uniform temperature a column with initial curvature of the form w a (x2 - lx)/2r and ends free to rotate is held at a uniform temperature. the geometry at the ends of the column are such that on rotation, the column length remains invariant. solving the differential equation associated with this situation and applying the necessary boundary conditions, the total deflection y t, for a at rise in temperature can be found to be equal to (sasselman, 1979): yt • - 5k2l4/384r - l 2/8r\\\\t .

(4.2.8.2) another thermal buckling resistance parameter can be defined as: [a (1 - v2) ]-1\\\\t (4.2.8.4) this parameter controls the critical temperature in thin plates and should be maximized to achieve maximum at c. all the thermal buckling resistance parameters developed in sections 4.2.3 through 4.2.8 can be applicable for two-dimensional structures if the modulus of elasticity e is replaced by e/(1 - v2). 4.2.9. effect of creep on thermal buckling failure by thermal buckling is due to the presence of external constraints which prevent free thermal expansion. removal of such constraints will automatically prevent the possibility of thermal buckling. such constraints can be removed by creep deformation in the column (or plate) or in the ex- ternal constraints. such creep will cause a permanent change in the geo- metry and size of the component subject to thermal buckling as well as the constraints. once this creep deformation has occurred, the possibility of thermal buckling is eliminated, unless the operating temperatures, purposely or by accident are raised significantly. for these reasons, at least qualitatively it can be concluded that creep deformation can have a beneficial effect on thermal buckling resis- tance. no quantitative rules for the selection of materials subject to creep thermal buckling for brittle materials, as far as these authors are aware, have appeared in the literature. the analysis of such selection rules is the subject of a study currently underway under sponsorship by the office of naval research. 38\\', \\'4.2.10. effect of geometry on thermal buckling behavior the discussions presented so far concentrated on columns or plates which are straight or exhibit slight curvature only. this type of geometry ex- hibits minimum compliance in the axial and in-plane directions of the column and plate respectively. this low compliance is directly responsible for the thermo-elastic instability in straight columns and the high bending moments in columns with slight curvature. for this reason, a major increase in thermal buckling resistance can be achieved by increasing the compliance in the direction of the external constraints. support for this conclusion is provided by the results of ganeeva (1956) and shapovalov (1964), which showed that for highly curved plates the critical temperature for buckling instability increases rapidly with the degree of curvature. it appears that from the design point of view, thermal buckling failure can be avoided by designing components with high curvature rather than straight or low degree of curvature. 4.2.11. conclusions (i) selection of materials with high thermal buckling resistance can be based on a number of different thermal buckling resistance parameters. it is im- portant to note that these parameters presented in this report are appropriate to a specific geometry, thermal environment and failure mode. for this reason, it is critical that prior to material selection, a careful analysis is con- ducted of the mode of buckling failure. important to note also is that relevant material properties can exhibit a strong temperature dependence. for this reason, the buckling failure mode and the relevant \"thermal buckling re- sistance parameter\" will also depend on the temperature level of operation. 39\\', \"(ii)failure by thermal buckling can be minimized by avoiding external constraints. for solar receivers this implies that all components subject to large total thermal expansion, be assembled with sufficient free space between them, such that differences in thermal expansions can be accommo- dated easily. (iii)thermal buckling failure can be controlled by the careful choice of geometry. for straight columns, low slenderness ratios are preferred. for initially straight column subject to large post-thermal buckling deformation or for columns with initial curvatures high slenderness ratios will permit excessive bending without risking tensile failure. conversely, high initial curvature increases the compliance and thereby increase thermal buckling re- sistance. (iv)creep deformation can be beneficial in improving thermal buckling re- sistance. for ceramic materials this effect is expected to\\'be beneficial at high temperatures near the anticipated upper operating temperatures of solar receivers. 4.3. transient heating and cooling 4.3.1. convective heat transfer in practice structures or components initially at thermal equilibrium can experience a sudden change in ambient temperature. in an extreme case, this occurs in a turbine engine experiencing a flame-out condition. a similar situation is encountered in the physical removal of an object from a high temperature structure such as a furnace. changes in the heat transfer coefficient or heat transfer mechanism in a structure at thermal equilibrium such as a nuclear reactor also involves a change in level of operating temperature. 40s\", \\'regardless of the details, such changes require that the structure or component must achieve new thermal equilibrium at a higher or lower temperature. this involves transient temperature changes, inevitably accompanied by transient thermal stresses. the transfer of heat to or from the structure or component undergoing a change in ambient temperature can occur by natural or forced convection. for newtonian heat transfer, in which the heat flux at any instant is directly proportional to the difference in temperature of the surface and the ambient atmosphere, solutions for the transient thermal stresses for simple geometries can be derived analytically. the results for the solid circular cylinder (jaeger, 1945) will be presented in detail, which are qualitatively similar to those for flat plates (boley and weiner, 1960) and spheres (crandall and cing, 1955). figure 4.3.1.1 shows the magnitude of the transient tensile thermal stresses encountered in the center of a solid circular cylinder of infinite length subjected to heating by an instantaneous increase (ot) in ambient tempera- ture (jaeger, 1945). it is common practice in thermal stress analysis to present the results in terms of a non-dimensional stress, c a o(1-v)/ a eat and non-dimensional time kt/a 2 where t is the real time and a is the radius of the rod. the stresses go through a transient maximum and are zero at t - 0 and t -* •. the magnitude of the stresses at any instant of time is a function of the biot number ; b•uh/e i where h is the treat trw..-r__.ice\\\\\\\\. ♦ coefficient. note that the magnitude of the maximum stress is not governed by the thermal diffusivity. differences in the thermal diffusivity for different materials only affect the time at which a given stress value is reached. for design purposes, the maximum value of the tensile stresses are of interest. over the range of 0.1 < b < 20 the stresses to a very

value of the biot number. for high values of 6, as indicated by eq. 4.3.1.3 the thermal stress resistance is independent of the thermal conductivity as well as the heat transfer coefficient and cylinder size. in contrast, at low values of the biot number, the thermal stress resistance is strongly affected by the values for the thermal conductivity, heat transfer coeffi- cient and radius of the cylinder. in fact, for a cylinder of given thermal conductivity, subjected to a given convective heat transfer condition, any desirable value of at maxcan be achieved simply by decreasing the cylinder size. 43 e\\', \"from the point of view of selection of materials, high values of ate require high values of the thermal stress resistance parameters, obtained from eqs. 4.3.1.3 and 4.3.1.4

flow, but of course, appropriate to a completely different &amour* of thermal stress resistance. it is important to note that due to the role of the \\'riot number, the relative thermal stress resistance of two different materials depending on their relative value of thermal conductivity may well be interchanged for conditions of high or low values of riot number. this latter observation is critical in assessing the relative thermal stress • resistance of materials by experimental methods and the use of these results for design purposes. ex- perimental comparisons of the relative thermal stress resistance frequently use relatively small laboratory specimens. for these, the specimens size and thermal conductivity play an important part in establishing the measured values of 4t max . however, these experimental results are no longer appro- priate for larger sized structures scaled-up from laboratory models. lack of appreciation of this fact, can (and has) led to major errors in the design_ and selection of materials for high-temperature structures. expressions, identical in form, but differing only in their values of the numerical constants, can be derived for other geometries such as plates and spheres. for this reason, the above conclusion for the solid cylinder, should be generally applicable to other geometries as well. 44\", \\'predictions of values of at maxfor thereto-elastic theory have shown reason- able agreement with experimental data (clenny and royston, 1953), (hasselman and crandall, 1963; hasselman, 1970). any discrepancies between calculated and observed values most likely can be attributed to uncertainties in the values of the heat transfer coefficient and the magnitude of the failure stress. it should be noted that the above discussion and results assumed the existence of newtonian heat transfer (i.e. a constant heat transfer co- efficient for the total period over which the material comes to thermal equilibrium)• under conditions of natural convection, however, heat trans- fer coefficients generally decrease as the thermal equilibrium is approached. preliminary results obtained by the present writers, by finite element analy- sis, show that under these conditions the thermal stresses are less than those given by eq. 4.3.1.1 especially at the higher values of heat transfer coefficients. for this reason, under ccnditions of natural convection, eqs. 4.3.1.2, 4.3.1.3 and 4.3.1.4 for at maxre},resent conservative estimates. 4.3.2. transient heat transfer. controlled rate of heating in principle, thermal stress failure can be avoided by controlling the rate of heating such as placing an upper limit on the rate of change of surface temperature. in practice, this could be done by careful control of the heat transfer coefficient in convective heat transfer or controlled filtering or masking of incident radiant energy. this latter approach may possibly provide a solution to the severe thermal shock expected for components of solar collectors under intermittent cloud cover conditions. 45\\', \\'st(1-v)k ae(4.3.2.3)the role of the pertinent material properties which control the . thermal stress resistance of brittle ceramics is indicated by the solution for the maximum thermal stress in a flat plate cooled by a constant rate of change of surface temperature (buessum, 1960): _ aeb2 dtc\\\\t3(1-v)k dt

s\\\\taeb2(4.3.2.2) eq. 4.3.2.2 indicates that materials which can be subjected to high rates of cooling should have high values of the thermal stress resistance parameter: furthermore, for a given material, high cooling rates can be tolerated by keeping the plate thickness as low as possible. on dimensional grounds, these conclusions should also be valid for controlled heating rates. 4.3.3. radiation heat transfer radiation is a principal mode of heat transfer in solar collection system and an important possible source of thermal stress failure. the functional response to the incident solar radiation and corresponding thermal 46\\', \\'stress state for any design of solar collection system depends upon the particular component under consideration. mirrors, which concentrate the solar radiation, should absorb little or no part of the incident radiation and should have high reflectivity. on the other hand, the window, which permits the concentrated solar flux to be incident on the solar receivers, should have low reflectivity and should transmit as such radiation as possible. in contrast, the receiver, which converts the radiation flux into heat energy, should have high absorptivity. it is expected that these three components should exhibit different thermal responses to the incident radiation, with each having different material requirements. as will be shown, the material requirements for high efficiency in converting solar energy into another form may not be necessarily compatible with other performance criteria such as high thermal stress resistance. therefore, an optimization of material properties will have to be made in order to achieve high conversion effi- ciency in addition to high thermal stress resistance. the assessment of the magnitude of thermal stresses in material sub- jected to radiation heating or cooling can be quite complex. heat transfer in radiation mode is proportional to the fourth power of the absolute tem- perature. in addition, spectral and temperature dependence of the pertinent material properties combined with the internal absorption and re-emission of the incident radiation introduces further complexities. for this reason, the evaluation of thermal stress in radiation environments, in general, requires numerical techniques. as stated before, such numerical techniques are useful and essentie^ in practice for a specific component design with known spectral and temperature dependence of material pro- perties and heat transfer environment. however, the analytical solutions 47\\', \\'necessary to indicate the general role of the pertinent material properties must be based on a number of simplifying assumptions. a number of such solutions were obtained by the present authors and co- workers (hasselman, 1963, 1966; hasselman et al., 1980; thomas at al., 1980; singh at al., 1980a,b) for materials subjected to incident radiation heating. these studies included materials which are opaque, semi-transparent and partially absorbing. the semi-transparent materials were assumed to be transparent below a given wavelength and opaque above this wavelength. in partially absorbing materials, the incident radiation gets absorbed, while being transmitted through them. depending upon the external cooling con- ditions, the internal absorption of the incident radiation can result in a temperature distribution such that the interior of the structure may be at higher temperature than the surface known as \"thermal trapping\" effect. a simplifying assumption common to these solutions was that the temperature of the material was kept sufficiently low that the effect of any re-emitted radiation could be neglected. this assumption permitted to regard the incident radiation, for all practical purposes, to consist of a constant heat flux. this assumption was found to be valid in all cases because the thermal stresses reach their maximum value at or near the initial stage of thermal history before the material becomes hot. it was also assumed that the optical properties of the material are \"grey\", i.e., independent of wavelength. however, the spectral dependence of the material properties can be easily taken into account by superposition of a number of analytical solutions for appropriate wavelengths. the highlights of these analytical and numerical results pertinent to different components in a solar collecting system and the role of the material properties will be given below. for convenience, the reprints or the cipies of the studies cited are presented in appendices 4.3.3(a-f). 48 1\\', \"a. opaque sphere subjected to symmetric radiation heating this analysis by hasselman (1963) involved the evaluation of thermal stresses in a cylinder, sphere and \\'let plate subjected to radiation heating all around without any cooling taking place. such heat transfer environment is pertinent to the solar receivers when they are subjected to radiant heat flux without any circulating fluid around them due to a malfunction of the circulating pump. the maximum steady state (t j -) tensile thermal stress in a sphere occurs in the center of the sphere and is given by: o\\\\t- 1 a eegoa \\\\t(4.3.3.1)max 5 (1-0k where q  is the intensity of the radiant heat flux, k is the thermal conductivity, e is the young\\'s modulus of elasticity, a is the ceeffic.ient of thermal expansion, e-1-r is the emissivity, r is the reflectivity, v is the poisson\\'s ratio and a is the radius of the sphere. as can be seen in equation 4.3.3.1, the magnitude of the maximum stress depends upon the intensity of heat flux in addition to many other physical and optical properties of the material. therefore the maximum permissible heat flux should be such that the thermal stresses developed do not exceed the allowable stress for the material in order to avoid failure. thus, to examine the effects of various material and geometric parameters on the magnitude of the maximum permissible heat flux, the analytical expres- sion for the maximum permissible heat flux, gmax, was obtained from equation 4.3.3.1 by equating the maximum tensile stress to the strength of the

that t14 << tmax4. therefore, equation 4.3.3.3 becomes from equations 4.3.3.2 and 4.3.3.4, the expression for maximum per- missible temperature for radiant heat flux without causing any failure can be

the sphere was subjected to radiation heating all around with no cooling. this analysis is quite pertinent to materials for wicdows in solar receivers. a typical window material, such as quartz, has very low absorptance for the radiation in the range of 1-2 .6u while the absorptance increases rapidly above this wavelength. the maximum permissible heat flux, g max , for a sphere is given by: and

environment is very common to the solar receivers i\\\\t where the radiation is incident on only one side and cooling takes place at 51\", \\'the other side by convection. figure 4.3.3.1 shows the schematic of a plate (thickness w 2a) assymmetrically heated by radiation and cooled by convection with heat transfer coefficient, h. the expressions for the maximum tensile stress are lengthy (appendix 4.3.3.c) due to assymmetric nature of heat transfer and, therefore, only the numerical results will be presented for the general case. however, for limiting values of optical thickness, us, the expressions will be simplified and the results will be presented in an- alytical form. results for three cooling conditions are presented below. heat transfer coefficient, h - finite figure 4.3.3.2 shows the time aapeadence of the maximum tensile thermal stress for ua - 3 and various values of.heat •transfer coefficient, h. it can be noted that the value of steady state (t m) stress is independent of h whereas the maximum transient stress is an inverse function of h. the steady state stress does not depend on h because the temperature profile in this case is independent of h even though the magnitude of temperature is an in- verse function of h. this conclusion can be shown to be true for any value of ua. the value of the maximum tensile stress as a function of us for steady state (t + -) condition is shown in figure 4.3.3.3. the plot shows a peak at an optical thickness (us) of 2.0 with zero values of stress at us - 0 and •. the stresses are zero for ua 0 because no heat is absorbed at all in the material. although, for ua - •, all the heat is absorbed in the surface, the distribution of temperature at steady state (* + m) is linear resulting in zero stress. the peak in the steady state stress is due to the maximum thermal trapping effect at ua - 2.0. the analytical expressions for thermal stress for finite h is too complex (appendix 4.3.3.0 to derive simple

optical thickness, us as shown below. neat transfer coefficient, h - 0 figure 4.3.3.3 shows the value of the maximum tensile stress at steady state (t - -) as a function of the optical thickness, us (appendix 4.3.3.0). the stresses are zero at us - 0, monotonically increases with us and plateau at high values of us. since there is no cooling (h - 0), the temperature of the plate increases with time. however, as mentioned before, the stresses reach their maximum value in the initial part of transient state before the plate gets very hot. this permits the assumption of constant heat flux for stress calculations. it is interesting to point out that the maximum tensile thermal. stress, at least for small values of us, occurs in the front face of the plate which is at the high temperature (appendix 4.3.3.c, figure 6). this result has significant engineering implication to be discussed later. the expressions for maximum permissible heat flux were obtained by simplifying the stress equation for optically thick (us - -) and optically thin oa << 1) plates as follows. for optically thick plate, the maximum steady-state tensile stress occurs in the center (x - 0) of the plate and is

3.18) equation 4.3.3.18 indicates that in order to obtain high thermal stress resistance, high values of tensile strength and thermal conductivity in combination with low values of coefficient of thermal expansion, poisson\\\\\\'s ratio, young\\\\\\'s modulus, emissivity and absorption coefficient are required. furthermore, equations 4.3.3.12, 4.3.3.13 and 4.3.3.17 clearly indicate that high thermal stress resistance is always associated with smaller component size. at this point, it is important to mention that in this case, the heat absorbed in the plate has to be conducted through the total plate thickness before it can be removed at the rear surface. this effect results in a high temperature difference in the plate especially for high values of the opti:al thickness, us. d. semi-absorbing flat plate subjected to radiation heating and convection cooling at the front surface this kind of thermal environment (appendix 4.3.3.d) is another likely design configuration for solar receivers. a qualitative evaluation of the two systems, viz., front and rear cooling suggests that the maximum tempera- ture difference in the plate at steady state in case of front heating with rear. cooling sill exceed that encountered in the case where heating and cool- ing both occurs in the front face. this is because, as mentioned before, in case of heating in the front and cooling in the rear surface, the heat ab- 1 •\\\\t 58\\', \\'sorbed in the plate has to be conducted through the total plate thickness before it can be removed at the rear surface. however, in case of front cooling, the heat is immediacaly removed from the surface with little or no heat ahf ,;rbed inside the plate resulting in more uniform temperature in the plate. for high incident heat flux, this my result in higher front sur- face temperature in case of rear cooling than the: in case of front cooling for a given temperature of the cooling environment. the uniformity of temperature distribution in a plate subjected to heating and cooling in the front face has important implication for the design of solar receivers to be discussed later. the results for the thermal stresses for three cooling conditions are discussed below. heat transfer coefficient, t - finite figures 4.3.3.4 and 4.3.3.5 show the plots for the maximum stress as a function of time and optical thickness respectively. a comparison of these results with those for the case of assyrmetric heating with cooling at the rear surface (figures 4.3.3.2 and 4.3.3.3) indicates that the stress plots are qualitatively similar in nature in both cases. however, a comparison of stress profiles indicates that the stress distributions are different. in addition, the transient stress and the times to reach the transient peak are different in two cases (see appendices 4.3.3.0 and 4.3.3.d). heat transfer coefficient h - 0 for h - 0, the thermal environments for flat plate subjected to radia- tion heating and convection cooling in front surface is identical to the previously discussed case where the cooling takes place at the rear surface. consequently, the results will be identical and the reader is referred to section

\\'depending upon the design configuration of the solar receiving system, solar receivers may be subjected to symmetric heating and cooling. as ex- plained in section 4.3.3.d, the symmetric cooling is expected to result in a uniform temperature in the plate. the thermal stresses for three cooling conditions are discussed below (see appendix 4.3.3.e). heat transfer coefficient, h - finite figure 4.3.3.6 shows the plot for the stresses in the surface and the center of the plate as a function of time. two interesting features can be noted here. first, similar to assymmzetric heating, the steady-state stress is independent of h whereas the maximum transient stress is sn inverse function of h. second, the maximum stress reverses its sign between the transient and steady- state conditions. this results from the effect of non-uniform internal heat genera- tion and associated thermal trapping effect (singh et al, 1980, appendix 4.3.3.f). for finite values of heat transfer coefficient, h, the variation of the maximum transient and steady-state tensile thermal stress as a function of the optical thickness, us is shown in figure 4.3.3.7. similar to the assym- metric

importance of thermal stresses in semi-absorbing plate and their relevance to the solar receiving systems, the results for thermal stresses are summarized for the convenience of reader, as follows: 1.for h - finite or -, the steady state stresses are minimum for highly transparent (ua- oo) and opaque (ua+-) materials with high values of thermal stress for intermediate values for us for both symmetric and assymmetric heating cases. on the other hand, for h - 0, steady state (ti-) stresses in- crease monotonically with ua so that semi-transparent materials develop higher values of stress than the transparent (us -) materials. 2.for highly transparent materials (ua-0) with assymmetric heating, the maximum steady state stress is proportional to u and a 2 for h-finite, 0 and -, whereas for symmetric heating, the maximum steady state stress is proportional to u and a 2 for h-finite and • and to u 3 and a4 for h-0. 3.for opaque materials (pa —), the maximum steady state stress approaches zero for h-finite and - for both assymmetric and symmetric heating. in con- trast, the stress reaches a constant finite value for h - 0. 4.the peak values for steady state stress with h-finite or - occurs at u • 2 for assymmetric heating, whereas it occurs at ua 2 1.334 for symmetric heating. 5.althc:ugh, the magnitude of steady state (t+-) stresses in case of as- symmetric heating for high values of us are almost identical for both front and rear cooling, the steady state stresses for lower values of ua as well as the transient stresses for both cases are different. in addition, time to reach the maximum transient stress is smaller in case of front cooling than that in case of rear cooling with a more uniform temperature distribution in case of front surface cooling than that in case of rear surface cooling.i 68\\', \\'6. although, the nature of the maximum steady-state stress plots are qualitatively very similar for both assymmetric and symmetric heating cases, the magnitude of the peak stress in assysmietric heating case is smaller than that in symmetric heating case. this is, at least in part, due to the fact that in case of assymmetric heating, the differential thermal strain can be accommodated by bending which is not the case for symmetric heating. g. general comments based on the above mentioned analyses and discussion, the following general comments are made with regard to material properties, component size as well as the system design and operation: (a) for the high collection efficiency, the reflector and the window should absorb the least amount of radiation whereas the receiver should absorb most of the radiation. since, for a given intensity of incident radiation, the amount of radiation absorbed in the surface and the interior increases a th idcreasing value of a-1-r and u respectively, high :ollection efficiency will require: low c and u for reflectors and windows and high c and u for receivers a close look at these results indicates that the requirements of low a and u for reflectors and windows in order to achieve high col- lection efficiency is compatible with those for high thermal stress resistance. in contrast, the high collection efficiency requires high values for c and u for receivers which is incompatible with the requirements of low c and u for high thermal stress resistance. how- ever, as ua \\\\xad, the value of steady-state thermal stzess approaches zero. therefore, in order to achieve high collection efficiency and low thermal stresses, the receivers should havk practically higbest p6ssible value of vs. s 69\\', \\'(b)since the peak values of steady state stress with h a finite and • occurs at ua a2 for assymmetric heating and at ua=1.334 for symmetric heating, the intermediate values of us should be avoided in order to minimize thermal stress failure. (c)for high thermal stress resistance for materials in solar re- ceivers, the component size should be as small as practically possible. (d)in case of assymmetric heating with cooling at the rear surface, the maximum tensile thermal stress, for small values of optical thick- ness, us, occurs in the front face of the plate which is at the highest temperature. this could be very critical for environments which promote fatigue by slow crack growth discussed in a separate section. slow crack-growth which could occur by stress corrosion or other mechanism, is a thermally activated process and is enhanced by high temperature and stress. therefore, it is desirable to keep the critical regions (highly stressed) at low temperature in order to minimize the slow crack growth. (e)a close comparison of the results for two cases of assymmetric heating clearly indicates that the temperature distribution in case of front cooling is more uniform that that in case of rear cooling. there- fore, for a given temperature of the cooling environment the temperature of the front surface will be higher in case of rear cooling than that in case of front cooling. high temperature may result in deleterious effects such as thermal fatigue and melting, etc. in addition, a more uniform temperature distribution in case of front cooling will result in smaller de g,)rmation of the plate. therefore, from design point of view, system with heating and cooling on the same side may be preferred over the one where heating and cooling take place on opposite sides of the plate. 70\\', \"m the fact that transient stresses in a partially absorbing plate due to internal heat generation is inversely proportional to the heat transfer coefficient, h, suggests that during the transient heating period of the solar receivers, the working fluid must be circulated at a faster rate to induce high h value. on the other hand, during a sudden decrease of radiant heat flux such as during :loud cover, the value of the heat transfer coefficient, h should be reduced by lower- ing the circulation rate of working fluid in order to minimize the severity of thermal shock. (g)the steady-state stress for high values of us is very small and approaches zero. however, the transient stresses may be of high magni- tude even for very high values of us. these stresses are directly proportional to the radiant heat flux. therefore, to minimize the thermal stress failure, the transient stresses can be reduced by gradually increasing the incident heat flux towards the final steady- state value rather than subjecting the plate to frill value of heat flu: at t-0. (h)thermal stress resistance parameters for different heat transfer environments can be summarized as: st(l-v)k\\\\tst(1-v)k 1/4\\\\tst(1-v)k 1/4 a ec\\\\t a ee —i\\\\t ia ee (1-f1}\\' 0 st(1-v)k\\\\tst(1-v)k aeeu\\\\t aecu3 h. recommendations for future theoretical work (a) an important situation where the solar receivers will be subjected to thermal shock is the incidence of intermittent cloud cover. the 71\", \\'intarmittent cloud cover will cause high thermal stresses inside the structure as a result of thermal shock. these stresses are very complex to evaluate due to the mixed nature of radiation and convec- tion cooling. to date, such stress solutions are not available in the literature. however, it is very important to analyze those stresses for the selection of suitable material and the optimum design. (b) in the above analyses, the optical properties have been assumed to be independent of temperature and wavelength of t:_e incident radia- tion. however, it is expected that these properties will vary with temperature and wavelength of the incident radiation. it is, there- fore, recommended that the thermal stress analyses should be extended to include these spectral and temperature dependence of the optical properties of the material. 4.4. thermoviscoelastic stress relaxation 4.4.1. general under conditions of mechanical stress, materials can exhibit slow deformation by creep. such creep deformation also is ex pected to occur under conditions of thermal stress. ceramic materials will exhibit creep by diffusional processes at levels of temperature at which vacancy con- centration and mobility become appreciable. these temperatures correspond to about one half to two thirds of the melting point of the material. temperature levels in point-focus solar receivers may well reach le- vels at which creep deformation could be appreciable. for this reason, creep under conditions of thermal stress should be considered in the design and selection for materials of construction of solar receivers. 72\\', \\'creep deformation under conditions of thermal stress, generally is favorable as it leads to stress relaxation. for this reason, the occur- rence of creep reduces the probability of failure by thermal stresses. the magnitude of thermal stresses due to external constraints will decrease with increasing time. therefore, thermal stress relaxation by creep leads to an increase in the thermal condition (i.e. at max , gmax, etc.) to which a material can be subjected without thermal stress failure, to a value greater than if no stress relaxation occurred. in general, the higher the creep rate, the more rapid thermal stress relaxation will occur, with a corresponding greater thermal stress re- sistance. the derivation of analytical expressions for the magnitude of thermal stress affected by creep is highly complex, if possible at all. in general, the kinetics of creep is a function of the temperature as well as stress. for this reason, in a body subjected to non-isothermal con- ditions, thermal stress relaxation can occur by a multitude of mechanisms. complex, numerical methods based on finite element principle are required for such calculations (poritsky and fend, 1958). only for thermal stresses which occur under isothermal conditions due to external constraints such as encountered during thermoslastic instability (buckling), analytical expressions for the stresses and stability condition can be derived for linear creep behavior, i.e., a creep rate which is directly proportional to the stress. for these reasons, derivations of expressions for the purposes of obtaining thermal stress resistance parameters for thermal ;,tress re- laxation, in general cannot be obtained unless grossly simplifying assump- tions are introduced. 41\\\\t 73\\', \\'4.4.2. steady-state heat flow in such an analytical study, reproduced in appendix 4.4.2.a, one of the authors of this report (hasselman, 1967) noted that the rate of creep in a thermal stressed structure corresponding to the stress at the posi- tion of lowest temperature, represents a lower bound on the rate of thermal stress relaxation. this concept was applied to a hollow circular cylinder under- going steady-state heat flow, treated in section 4.1 of this report. it was pointed out that as thermal stress relaxation occurred, the values of the maximum temperature difference or heat flux across the wall could be increased, at a rate such that the maximum value of tensile thermal stress remained constant. on this basis, the maximum rate of rise of the temperature difference across the cylinder wall for a ceramic material undergoing linear creep was derived to be: whered(ot max)\\\\ts`(1-v) dt\\\\tgan c\\\\t[21n(a )] -1[\\\\t2 1 - b2 .2 in (a)](4.4.2.1) (4.4.2.2) similarly, the heat

parameters: st(1-v)\\\\t st(1-v)r a n\\\\tand\\\\tan\\\\t (4.4.2.6) it is of interest to note that the above parameters do not contain young\\'s modulus as a material property. the reason for this is that the amount of creep strain required for a degree of stress is an inverse func- tion of young\\'s modulus of elasticity. since the magnitude of the thermal stresses is directly proportional to young\\'s modulus, the rate of change of at maxor gmax are independent of young\\'s modulus. important to rote is that these equations represent lower bounds on the rate of rise of at maxor q max. as time progresses and the changes in at and q involves changes in the absolute temperature, these rates can be modified. 4.4 3. remarks although to first appearance, thermal stress relaxation appears favorable from the point of view of reducing the magnitide of stress, two unfavorable effects will occur. first, as pointed out previously, thermal stress relaxation under non-isothermal condition, can result in un- acceptably high values of residual stress, whenever the material is brought to thermal equilibrium at lower temperature. for most engineering structures or materials, with the exception of tempered glass, the formation of such residual stresses generally is unfavorable for continued satisfactory per- formance. in addition, thermal stress relaxation can lead to considerable deformation of the component or structure, which also cculd have an adverse 75f\", \\'effect on subsequent performance. it is the view of the writers of this report, that materials for solar receivers should be chosen to keep thermal stress relaxation to an absolute minimum. ;onversely, operating temperatures should be kept sufficiently low that creep deformation is prevented. 4.5. thermsl fatigue (k i 1 kic) 4.5.1. general brittle ceramic materials under conditions of static or cyclic stress can exhibit the growth of cracks at levels of stress intensity factor be- low the critical stress intensity factor (i.e. for ki < kic). this phenomenon is referred to as sub-critical crack growth. if for a given stress value or history, the total extent of crack growth is sufficient for the crack to become critical, failure will ensue. for constant or cyclic stress, this mode of failure is referred to as static or cyclic fatigue, respectively. subcritical crack growth can also occur under conditions of steady- state or cyclic thermal stress. the resulting failure is referred to as \"thermal fatigue.\" solar receivers, because of wide temperature excur- sions and/or non-linear steady-state temperature distributions will be sub- jected to thermal stress and should be susceptible to failure by \"thermal fatigue.\" in order to take tt..s effect into consideration in the design and selection of materials for solar receivers, the role of the individual factors which effect thermal fatigue behavior, as well as their interaction needs to be well understood. a framework by which such understanding can be developed is provided by the methodology for the prediction of fatigue behavior of brittle ceramics 76 h\\', \\'based on fracture-mechanical principles. basically, this methodology re- quires a knowledge of the size and geometry of the propagating crack, the kinetics of crack growth as well as the stress and temperature history to which the material is being subjected. in principle, with this information, the time required for the propagating crack to become critical (i.e. the time to failure) can be calculated for any stress and temperature history. for constant and cyclic stresses --nder iso-thermal conditions, expressions in analytical form are easily derived. for transient temperatures and thermal stresses, the time or number of cycles to failure are more con- veniently obtained by numerical methods. the results obtained by these latter techniques, however, are less useful for the specific identification of the variables which control thermal fatigue behavior. for this reason, analytical expressions for the time-to-failure t  for an isothermal steady- state stress, following the approach of hasselman and zdaniewski (1978), (appendix 4.5.1.a), will be presented below: as shown by evans (1972), the time-to-failure (t f) for a brittle material subjected to an isothermal constant tensile stress (a) is given by: kic tf - [2/a2y2] i\\\\t[kidki/v] \\\\t (4.5.1.1) kt.i where y is a geometric constant which relates the value of tensile stress to the mode i stress intensity factor, k i by: ki - aya1/2\\\\t(4.5.1.2) where a is the crack size. k i - ki(t - 0) and v is the crack velocity which for many materials can be expressed as: 77\\', \\'v a ae exp(-q/rt) where a and n are constants and q is the activation energy for the parti- cular mechanism responsible for the crack growth.. 4.5.2. steady-state heat flow for steady state-heat flow, substitution of the expression for the max- imam tensile stress for any configuration due to an imposed temperature dif- ference, heat flux or other thermal condition in eq. 4.5.1.1, will yield an expression for the time-to-failure in terms of the variables which affect the magnitude of thermal stress as well as those which affect the sub- critical crack growth. one should be careful to note that this approach is based on the implicit assumption that the thermal stress intensity factor can be calculated from the value of thermal stress obtained from thermo- elastic principles for a continuum and the crack size and geometry as given by eq. 4.5.1.2. this assumptf -dn is expected to lead to reliable results as long as the crack size is small (say ` - 1%) relative to the size of the component or structure. for crack sizes, however, which are an appreciable fraction of the body size, the above approach will lead to an over-estimate of the thermal stress intensity factor, due to the effect of the crack on the effective compliance. for this case, the dependence of the thermal stress intensity factor on crack size needs to be established. for this, analytical or numerical techniques are available such as those employed by stahn et al., (1977a,b), stern (1979) and emery and co-workers (1969 a,b). since the present approach neglects the effect of the crack on the compliance, the expressions for the time-to-failure, in fact, are conservative. 78 0\\', \"for the derivation of the time-to-failure, rasselman and zdaniewski (1978) used an expression for the thermal stress of the form: c - caeat/(1-v)\\\\t (4.5.2.1) where c is a geometric constant, which, for instance, for a hollow cir- cular cylinder subjected to steady-state radial heat flow, can be obtained from eq. 4.1.5.1 presented in an earlier section of this report. substitution of eq. 4.5.2.1 into eq. 4.5.1.1, and assuming that kii << kci , results in: tf - [2(1-v)2exp(q/rt)]/[cmfat)2y2a(n-2)kii(n-2)] (4.5.2.2) where kii can be obtained (equation 4.5.1.2) knowing the initial stress a, geometric constant y and the initial crack length a. examination of eq. 4.5.2.2, indicates that a calculation for the time- to-failure for steady-state heat flow, expressed in terms of an imposed temperature difference, involves a total of twelve different variables, in- cluding material properties, environmental conditions as well as geometric and dimensional variables. eq. 4.5.2.2 can be rewritten in terms of a given value of heat flux q, related to at by q - c\\'k t where c\\' is another geometric constant. sub- stitution of this relation for at in eq. 4.5.2.2 results in: t  - 2(1-v) 2(kc\\')2exp(q/rt)/(cbl eq)2y2a(n-2)kii(n-2) (4.5.2.3) this equation involves a total of thirteen variables with (c\\'/c) 2 being considered as a single geometric constant. 79 n a\", \"additional variables can be introduced by substitution for a the expression for the maximum tensile thermal stress at steady state (t - -) for the semi-absorbing flat plate subjected to normally incident radiation. this specific case introduces the reflectivity, the absorption coefficient and the plate thickness as additional variables, bringing.the grand total of sixteen independent variables which must be known before a thermal fatigue calculation can be made. for the time-to-failure for a semi- absorbing material subjected to time-dependent incident radiation, the thermal diffusivity must be taken into account as well, bringing the total number of independent variables to seventeen. the designer may be interested in the maximum temperature difference, heat flux, etc. to which a given component can be subjected to assure a minimum time-to-failure. such expressions can be obtained by a simple rearrangement of eqs. 4.5.2.2 and 4.5.2.3. for instance, eq. 4.5.2.2 for t  in terms of at can be rearranged to yield: 1/2 t\\\\t- [2(1-v)2exp(q/rt)]1/2[(caetf)2y2a(n-2)kii(n-2)] (4.5.2.4) and a similar expression for the maximum heat flux:

gmax\\' 80 e .a\", \\'4.5.3. thermal cycling the validity of the above mentioned general approach is provided by the results of badaliance at al., 1974 and hasselman at al., 1976 (appendices 4.5.3.a and 4.5.3.b) who studied the effect of sub-critical crack growth on the thermal fatigue behavior of soda-lime-silica glass subjected to a single or multi-cycle quench from a higher temperature into a water bath at lower temperature. the number of thermal cycles required for the onset of fast fracture were obtained by a numerical procedure which takes into account the continuous variation of stress and temperature. good agreement was found between the experimental and calculated data as shown in fig. 4.5.3.1. it is important to note, however, that the prediction of thermal fatigue behavior also requires an analysis based on the statistical nature of brittle fracture. this statistical effect causes a dependence of the fracture on the magnitude and distribution of the stress leading to differences in fracture probabilities. for this reason, the fracture stress (or critical flew size) under conditions of thermal stress can differ appreciably from the fracture stress (critical flaw size) determined in a tensile or other type of test. this implies that a statistical analysis of the fracture behavior of brittle ceramics is essential in order to predict the failure in thermal fatigue conditions. for isothermal, constant stress conditions, a number of such statistical studies have appeared in the literature (fracture mechanics of ceramics, 1974, 1978). in terms of eqs. 4.5.2.2 and 4.5.2.3 for t  as governed by an imposed temperature difference or heat flux, the following two parameters can be defined for the selection of the brittle ceramic with highest thermal

involved in addition to the rapid variation in heat flux as the result of variable cloud cover. it should be evident from the above discussion that for reliable predictions of the thermal fatigue behavior, a great deal of data need to be generated. the magnitude of thermal stresses and operating temperatures must be known quite accurately. in addition, numerous material properties, the size and geometry of the failure initiating flaws as well as the parameters which describe the statistical nature of fracture need to be evaluated. the parameters which control the sub-critical crack growth are a function of environmental conditions which can be highly variable. furthermore, because of the wide temperature ranges at which solar receivers are ex- pected to operate, it is conceivable chat the crack growth may prr•red by a number of different mechanisms simultaneously. this is particularly true under conditions of rapid heating and cooling. at the present time, it is quite likely that complete information required for thermal fatigue calculations is not available for even one brittle ceramic. establishing a data base for the prediction of thermal fatigue be- havior of all possible designs and candidate materials represents a task of considerable magnitude, not only in terms of technical effort, but also in terms of time. for these reasons, it is recommended that thermal fatigue analysis be limited to final design configurations and only for those materials which are likely to give satisfactory service. 83\\', \"4.6. critical crack propagation (r i > kic) 4.6.1. general as discussed in an earlier section of this report, thermal environments can be encountered in practice, for which even in the best materials avail- able, the onset of thermal stress fracture cannot be avoided. under these conditions, thermal stress resistance of brittle ceramics is based on their ability to undergo minimum crack propagation. in this manner, the ceramic will undergo a minimum change in its physical char p°teristics, such as strength and its geometry, so that it still can continue to satisfy the per- formance criteria of its specific application. as pointed out earlier, this particular philosophy for material selection is common in the refractories industries. it is clear that derivations of selection rules based on a minimum change in physical characteristics and geometry following thermal stress failure requires analyzing the variables which affect the propagation of cracks in brittle materials for thermal stress conditions such that k i -\\' ri .c literature studies for crack propagation in thermal stress fields are far less in number than those concarned u;-1th the analysis of thermal stresses and the onset of crack propagation. nevertheless, a small number of such studies related to the fracture-mechanics of crack propagation have been published (hasselman 1969, 1971 a,b; stahn and co-workers 1977a,b; bazant and co-workers 1979; emery and co-vorkers 1966, 1969b). in general, these studies indicate that the analysis of crack propagation in thermal stress fields is relatively complex. one of the reasons for this complexity is that the propagation of cracks affects the magnitude and distribution nf the thermal stresses due to the change in compliance of the structure or material undergoing fracture. crack interaction introduces a further r\\\\t84\", \"degree of complexity. for these reasons, at present, analysis of crack propagation in thermal stress ffalds must rely on numerical methods. as described earlier, such numerical methods are lass convenient for assessing the individual variables which control crack propagation in thermal stress fields. however, analytical solutions for the stability and propagation of cracks in simple mechanical models were obtained in studies by hasselman (1969, 1971a)reproduced as appendices (4.6.1a and 4.6.1e) to this report. these analytical approaches were permitted by the judicious choice of models consisting of a material tri-axially or uniaxially constrained from shrinking on cooling. from a continuum point of view, these constraints assure spatial uniformily of the thermal stress field regardless of the extent of crack propagation. the material was assumed to contain a uniform density of cracks of equal size. the complexity of the details of the stress distributions was circumvented by expressing the elastic response of the material in terms of an effective bulk or young\\'s modulus, expressed in terms of young\\'s modulus of the crack-free material and the density and size of the cracks. crack interaction effects were assumed to be absent. in respect to this latter a:_.umption, it should be noted, as in- dicated by preliminary results of studies currently underway by the present writers, that as long as co-planar crack prop^gation is avoided, crack interaction has a beneficial effect on both the onset as well as the extent of crack propagation in thermal stress fields. 4.6.2. analytical results the analytical studies for the two different mechanical models re- sulted in the same conclusions with regard to the nature of crack pro- pagation and the role of the pertinent material properties. for this reason, the prixcipal results for only one of the models will be presented 85\", \"here. reprints of the two analytical studies (hasselman, 1969, 1971a) presented as appendices to this report contain further information on the assumptions and mathematical details. for the thin flat plate, with a uniform density n of cracks of equal length t, uniaxially prevented from shrinkage on cooling by rigid constraints, the critical temperature difference on cooling, at., required for crack instability is (hasselman, 1971a): dtc a (2yf/wa 2e0l)1/2(1 + 2rni 2)\\\\t (4.6.2.1) where e  is young\\'s modulus of the crack-free plate. figure 4.6.2.1 shows the dependence of at  on a in dimensionless form for two values of crack density, indicated by two solid lines. these curves show that high values of at  can be achieved for either small or large crack sizes. this latter effect arises because at the large values of crack size the compliance of the plate is affected significantly. a minimum in at  occurs at a crack size, a -rem. from the point of view of the relevant material properties, for a given crack sizes and density. at  can be increased by selection of a material with a higher value of the parameter: (yf/a2e0)1/2\\\\t (4.6.2.2) it is important to cote that this latter conclusion could also be obtained from the vrovllia discussion on the criteria for the onset of tharmal fracture, simply by expressing the fracture stress in terms of the appropriate fracture-mechanical parameters. the validity of the fracture-mechanical approach is demonstrated further by an additional fracture phenomena of major importance to the 86\", \\'llj z wa zo - ll_voi <xucinwcl(n =q i\\\\t

of materials and the interpretation of fracture data as follows: referring to fig. 4.6.2.1 9 it is important to note a very basic difference in the propagation behavior of cracks with initial crack size to > im, at the onset of instability at 4t c. for i > i m, at at ^ 4t c9 the relation betwreen crack length and at is given by eq. 4.6.2.1. this mode of crack extension is referred to as a \"stable\" crack propagation. for 1  < im, however, after the onset of crack propagation at 4t c, the elastic energy released exceeds the energy required to create the new crack surfaces. this excess energy is converted to kinetic energy of the propagating crack assuming no other losses. this is referred to as dynamic or unstable crack propagation. \\\\tthe crack will cease propaga- tion at a final crack length r f, when all the kinetic energy and additional released elastic energy is transformed into surface fracture energy. for to << im, this value of final crack length can be derived to be\\\\t if - (4wnr o)-1\\\\t (4.6.2.3)\\\\\\' this expression indicates that for a given crack density, the crack length which results from unstable crack propagation is inversely pro- portional to the initial crack length and crack density and independent of other material properties. low values of if can be achieved only by increasing the initial crack length and the crack density. the implications of this conclusion for materials for which the initial crack length, t0 is not easily ascertained, can be examined by substituting into eq. 4.6.2.3 the griffith relation between crack size, tensile fracture stress, fracture surface energy and young \\\\\\'s modulus (for a single crack in a thin flat plate) which yields:\\\\t 88\\\\t c \\\\xad1_\\\\t -ao- \\\\t---\\', \"if m q2

of the selection of materials with optimum thermal shock resistance, it is critical to note that the requirement of low or moderate strength and high values of young \\'s modulus to minimize 89 0.\", \"_,\\\\t ^.._._ the extent of dynamic crack propagation is exactly opposite to the require- ment of a high value of fracture stress and low young \\'s modulus to prevent the onset of thermal stress fracture. these opposite requirements have created considerable confusion in the selection of materials for thermal a,ress applications and the interpretation of fracture data. for thermal environments in which the thermal stress fracture for even the best material is likely to occur, attempts could be made to increase the thermal stress resistance by increasing strength. this frequently is the only possible alternative since such properties as coefficient to thermal ex- pansion, young \\'s modulus, poisson\\'s ratio, thermal conductivity are not easily modified. this approach can have two effects. the strength improvements may be adequate such that the thermal stress failure is avoid- ed, as desired. however, very severe thermal environments may require ft improvements in strength by an order of magnitude or so. such improvements are not easily achieved with presently available materials and the current state of technology. in this case, any improvement in strength which can be obtained in practice will not be sufficient to prevent the onset of thermal stress fracture, but will only result in more extensive crack propagation and a further reduction in retained load-bearing ability. this latter phenomenon is of vital importance in the selection of materials for thermal environments in which thermal stress failure is likely to occur. in the view of the present writers, this may well be the case for the com- ponents of a solar receiver directly exposed to the incident solar radia- tion. h considerable body of experimental evidence for this type of fracture behavior of brittle ceramics was obtained in a number of laboratory 90\", \\'studies (hasselman 1970, gupta 1972, 1973, mai and atkins 1975, 1916). many of these studies concentrated on measuring both the severity of thermal shock required for the onset of fracture and the extent of crack pro- pagation as it affected the retained tensile load-bearing ability of the ceramic following fracture. many of these results are presented in a number of the appendices to this report. however, the implications of these results for the selection of brittle ceramics for severely thermal- ly stressed solar receivers are sufficiently important that a brief overview and discussion of their significance will be included in the main body of this report. for this purpose, fig. 4.6.3.1, indicates schematically the length of a crack and corresponding retained tensile strength as a function of severity of thermal shock. this latter quantity could include a tempera- ture difference, the magnitude of incident heat flux, rate of heating, etc. typically, in laboratory studies, the severity of thermal shock is measured by the temperature difference between the specimen

(1974) for a soda-lime-silica glass, shown in fig.4.6.3.4. this effect can be attributed to a very small flaw sire in the glass compared to the flaw size generally found in polycrystal- line ceramics or in other words, a low fracture toughness and young\\'s modulus and comparatively high strength. as indicated by the observations of crandall and ging (1955) for aluminum oxide and hasselman and shaffer for zirconium carbide (1962), unstable crack propagation can occur in an almost explosive manner with the resulting cracks extending completely through the sample. this, in effect, corresponds to zero retained strength. for this reason, for designs involving thermal shock of such severity that thermal stress fracture cannot be avoided, high-strength materials which fail in a highly unstable mode should not be selected. instead, materials with only moderate strength (i.e. large flaw size) will be found to be far more suitable in view of their stable nature of crack propagation. the advantage of the initially lower strength which results in re- latively smaller strength loss accompanying stable crack propagation is in- dicated in fig. 4.6.3.5(x) which shows the retained strength of a high- alumina refractory subjected to a water quench as measured in a study by larson et. al (1975), reproduced in appendix 4.6.3b. the discontinuity in strength at 6t c, typical for unstable crack propagation is absent. in fact, i eras found that the cracks formed even during the most severe quench were difficult to detect by optical or other means. this is due to the coarse and heterogeneous microstructure of these types of materials. it is evident that this type of crack propagation is preferred, since the material is still entirely capable of providing adequate service in its intended applications such as furnace linings, thermal inbulation, etc. 95\", \\'n a 0 s e,\\\\t 40\\\\tc alumina • t 9eryllia i mean t standard\\\\t a 30\\\\t deviation = zo ate (ai^) ^ otc c ouenching temperature difference, y.

extensive crack propagation than specimens of smaller size. it is anticipated that certain geometries may be less susceptible to such extensive crack propagation than other geometries. however, verification of this conclusion will require more experimental and theoretical work. in summary, for thermal shock of such severity that the nucleation of thermal stress fracture cannot be avoided, material selection should be based on the criterion that the extent of crach propagation be kept to a minimum. th.^s requires materials with moderate strength, hie. young\\'s modulus of elasticity, high surface fracture energy, low coefficient of thermal expansion and large nuober of cracks nucleated during fracture. a small component size is also preferred. the above recommendations should be relevant to solar receivers. for these, it is anticipated that during sudden heating or cooling as the re- sult of the passage of a cloud, the magnitude of the thermal stresses will approach or exceed the fracture stress. depending on the material of construction, this could result in explosive, catastrophic failure. if so, the designer may be tempted to choose or develop a notarial with increas-

parameters table ii summarizes the thermal stress resistance parameters pre- sented in the previous sections of this report. it should be noted that in presenting these parameters, redundancy has been avoided as much as for example, the parameters for thermal buckling failure as listed in table ii are appropriate for slender columns with narrow replacing e in these parameters by e/(1-v 2) results in equiva- lent parameters, appropriate to plates. in many of the other parameters listed in table ii for steady-state or transient heat transfer, deletion of the term (1-0 converts the parameter appropriate for a multi-axially stressed • configuration to a corresponding uni-axial one. furthermore, the parameters appropriate for radiation heating, by the addition or deletion of the exponent 1/4 can be converted to radiation temperature (tmax) ^* radiation heat flux (g max), respectively. even with these simplifications, table ii contains a total of twenty-seven non-redundant thermal stress resistance parameters. the two parameters, st(1-v)/ae and st(1-v)k/ae listed under steady-state and transient heat transfer, although dimensionally of the same form, nevertheless apply to completely different measures of thermal stress resistance. it is critical to note that the role of the individual material properties which affect thermal stress resistance differs from one parameter to another. for this very reason no general statement can be made of the relative thermal stress resistance for a given set of different materials. such relative thermal stress resistance can be\\',

\\'defined only if the heat transfer environment, failure mode, criterion of thermal stress resistance have been established. furthermore, it should be noted that these parameters consider ti. coral stress failure only, without considering other performance criteria, which will add a further complexity in the selection of materials. in fact, the criterion for high thermal stress resistance may well be incompatible with material requirement for other functional purposes. as an example, a material simultaneously may be required to exhibit high thermal stress resistance and good thermal insulating property. the first requirement demands a material with high thermal conductivity, whereas low thermal conductivity is essential to meet the second requirement. a similar contradiction exists for materials which may undergo catastrophic thermal stress failure, but which never- theless may be subjected to mechanical stresses of high magnitude. the first requirement requires a low to moderate tensile strength in order to keep the extent of crack propagation to a minimum. in con- trast, high tensile strength is required to meet the second requirement. clearly trade-offs need to be made. alternatively, major re-designs could be in order, if the material properties required for high thermal stress resistance are found to be incompatible with other functional requirements, to an extent that appropriate trade-offs cannot be made with the perhaps limited number of potential candidate materials. 5.2. comments on design values aul selection of property data for purpose of analytical convenience, the thermal stress resistance parameters presented above, were derived on the assumption that ceramic materials have well-defined values for their various properties. in practice, however, this assumption is far from the truth. in fact, for 103\\', \\'a number of reasons, considerable variation in ceramic property i can be encountered. a major reason for the variability in property values can bo bated to the lack of reproducibility of the manufacturing method, ceramic materials, which generally are based on powder-metallurgical techniques. such techniques are highly sensitive to even slight variation in powder characteristics such as particle size distribution, particle shape, impurities, pressure used in green-forming or hot- pressing, firing temperatures and times as well as heating and cooling rates. an extensive literature for these phenomena is available. such lack of reproducibility in the processing variables results in variation in the microstructural and other variables which critically affect many of the material properties. such microstructural variables include poro- sity (including pore amount, shape and size),grain size distributions, amount and distribution of second phase impurities and many others. a second reason for major property variation is their time-depen- dent behavior resulting from environmental effects encountered during operation such as corrosion, erosion, sub-critical or catastrophic crack growth, pore-migration, grain-growth, micro-cracking and other effects. a third, and not insignificant reason for the variability in ceramic property values is the uncertainty in establishing these values due to systematic, statistical and other effects. property data frequently are found to depend on the technique (with inherent assumptions) as well as the environmental conditions including atmosphere, specimen geometry and size, and other variables, under which they are measured. frequently, w\\\\t 104\\', \\'significant variations in property values can be found by different in- vestigators for the same material, measured by identical testing procedures. regardless of the reason for the variability in property data, the design engineer should be aware that such variability exists. handbook values should be treated with a great deal of caution. the reliability of available property data should be assessed in terms of the sophistica- tion and the assumptions inherent in the measurement technique, specimen quality and the statistical significance of the data. property data ob- tained from materials made under closely controlled laboratory conditions can differ significantly from the property data for materials made by mass production methods. special caution is advised with data for which the pertinent test conditions are not supplied. frequently, such data are given in qualitative terms such as \"excellent, good or poor.\" this latter statement applies particularly to data for thermal shock resistance, which neither provide information on the test method nor by which criterion such thermal shock resistance is defined. of the materia- properties which affect thermal stress resistance. some are more susceptible to variations than others. only minor uncer- tainties are expected with data for the coefficient of thermal expansion. this property is measured easily with relatively simple, standard equip- ment. furthermore, the coefficient of thermal expansion is not affected by micro-structural variation such as grain size or pore content. un- less excessive, impurity content has little or no effect on the value of coefficient of thermal expansion. micro-cracking in brittle composites or polycrystalline materials can alter the values of the coefficient of ther- mal expansion significantly. but then, micro-cracking generally decreases the coefficient of thermal expansion, which from the point of view of ther- mal stress resistance, must be considered favorable. 105\\', \\'elastic properties, too, can be measured by a number of straight forward methods. elastic property data obtained by acoustic methods should be considered highly reliable. data obtained by measurements of strains or deflections, especially at high temperature, should be treated with somewhat greater caution. some variation in elastic properties are expected as the result of variability in porosity or the presence of second phase. the pore morphology and distribution of second phases also affects elastic behavior. the relative influence of these effects will be governed by the :ontrol and the reproducibility of the manufacturing process. mirco-cracking can have a profound effect on elastic behavior, generally favorable to thermal stress resistance. such micro-cracking is a function of the grain size of the material which controls the size of the micro-crack pre-curs- ,rs, i.e. the pore at triple-points and grain boundaries. growth of such pte- cursor micro-cracks could cause time-dependent elastic behavior due to the gradual growth of aicro-cracks with time. service conditions such as corrosive effects could cause considerable decreases in elastic pro- perty values. the elastic moduli of materials which hrve undergone thermal stress failure can be significantly below the values for the unfractured material at the time of installation. optical properties pertinent to thermal stress resistance (i.e., the reflectivit y, emissivity and absorption coefficient] can be measured by straight-forward methods, although such measurements at high tempera- tures can be y prone to experimental difficulties. reflectivity is ex- pected to be controlled by the nature of the surface roughness and can be affected considerably by the presence of foreign matter, such as dust on the surface. in practice, then, reflectivity may exhibit a strongly t• 106\\', \\'time-dependent behavior, depending on the specific environmental conditions encountered in practice. the absorption coefficient is expected to be time-dependant due to a possible pick-up and/or migration of impurities. even for materials with very low absorption coefficient the transmission of radiation throtgh a material can be strongly effected by scattering at such micro-structural features as a residual pore phase (with size being very critical) and grain-boundaries. even slight differences in such features can create major differences in the optical transmissivity. time-dependent pore migration or pore growth as wall as grain growth would lead to a time- dependent optical transmission under service conditions. the thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity generally exhibit property value variations well in excess of the relative variations found in the coefficient of thermal expansion, elastic and optical behavior. compilations of data for the thermal conductivity can show data scatter of an order of magnitude at a given temperature for nominal- ly lhe same material. this excessive scatter in data can be attributed to differences in material quality as well as major experimental diffi- culty in obtaining reliable data especially at high temperature. thermal conductivity as well as thermal diffusivity are very strongly affect- ed by impurity levels as well as the presence and the morphology of a pore phase and/or second phase inclusions. the presence of cracks es- pecially at the lower temperature levels can cause a major decrease in the ability of a material to conduct heat. unknown or unaccounted for heat losses in the experimental measurement of the thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity art a as.jor contribution to the scatter in data. 107\\', \\'the uncertainty in the data for the beat conduction properties introduces a corresponding uncertainty in the estimates of the tempera- ture and thermal stresses and interpretation of experimental results for the performance of solar receivers. in fact, significant under. or overestimates of the efficiency can result from erroneous data for the thermal conductivity. it is unfortunate that in spite of their variability and their absolute necessity, heat conduction data for candidate materials, especially ceramics, for high—temperature technology is relatively sparse. such scarcity in part can be attributed to the relatively high cost and complexity of such measurements. nevertheless, it is urgently recommended that a development and testing program of solar receivers be assisted by extensive measurements of heat conduction properties, preferably on the very same materials or components used in a test structure. the phenomena related to the mechanical failure of brittle ceramic materials is expected to introduce major uncertainty in the design of structures for high-temperature technology in general and solar receivers in particular. a considerable body of literature (see for instance fracture mechanics of ceramics, vols. 1,2,3 and 4, 1974, 1978). in- dicates that the strength,fatigue and crack propagation behavior of brittle ceramics is controlled by a wide variety of factors. ideally, a material should fail at a given stress level. unfortunately, for brittle ceramics this statement is far from the truth. experimentally the failure stress of brittle materials has been found to be a function of the grain size as well as the presence of a 108\\', \\'pore phase. the grain size distribution and orientation s well as the pore morphology are expected to be significant variables as well. the method of surface preparation or surface damage occurred during service can have a profound negative effect on the magnitude of the failure stress. environmental effects such as temperature and level of humidity or other surface -active molecules also can affect the magnitude of the strength and fatigue -life considerably. of significance is that the strength o^ brittle ceramics is a function of the method by which it is measured. it has been found experi- mentally that strength is affected by the stressing rate, the size and geometry of the test specimens, the method of loading as well as the distribution of stress within the specimen. even for a given test method, strength data show a large degree of scatter with coefficients of varia- tion as high as twenty -five percent for many high -strength brittle cera- mics. worse yet, significant difference in strength data have been found by different investigators for the identical material tested under presumably identical conditions. fatigue-life under steady-state or cyclic load even for a set of identical specimens may show variations of as much as three orders of magnitude for a given stress level. such scatter in strength and fatigue- life can be attributed to differences in the size, geometry or orientation of the failure -initiating flaws. measurements of property data related to critical crack propagation such as fracture toughness (rib) or fracture energy indicate that micro- structural effects such as grain size and porosity can play a significant role. temperature also plays an important role especially at levels 109\\', \"where inelastic effects become prominent. in service, material degrada- tion due to corrosion effects also is expected to modify crack propaga- tion considerably. taking into account the collective uncertainties of all material properties discussed above, indicates that reliable predictions and/or quantitatively significant interpretation* of experimental data of the thermal stress behavior of ceramic materials foi solar receivers, is a relatively complex task. quantitative data for all these effects should be established for all candidate materials. with this information, estimates of strength performance and fatigue behavior can be based on statistical theories such as those advanced by weibull and many others (1951), coupled with failure prediction methodology and proof-testing based on fracture-mechanics. principles (see fracture mechanics of ceramics, vols, 1, 2, 3 anti 4) . in the absence of complete information, due to budgetary or other constraints, the design engineer can take a very conservative approach. this would require assumptions of design stresses of the order of no more than ten to twenty percent c\\' the fracture stresses determined on laboratory specimens made and tested under closely controlled conditions. the same approach should be taken in the design, relying entirely on experimental thermal shock data obtained in appropriate test facilities. it is expected, however, that such a conservative approach may limit the indicent heat flux, potential efficiencies and power output of solar receivers to levels which are n:,t economically justified. on the other hand, operation at higher flux levels may result in replace- went of component at too frequent intervals. 110\", \\'for all the above reasons, it is recommended that in the construction of solar receivers, design configurations be selected with minimum levels of thermal stress, by careful selection of materials and by following design recommendations outlined in a subsequent section of this report.t s\\\\t 111\\', \\'6. emct of dimensional and geometric varimles and non-uniform seating or cooling on thermal stress resistance a general survey of the results presented in section 4 of this report, indicates that a number of conclusions can be drawn in regard to the effect of dimensional and geometric effects on thermal stress resistance of brittle ceramic materials. cirstly, for nearly all thermal environment= as indicated, for ersmpis by representative equations: 4.1.6.1, 4.3.2.1, 4.3.3.1 9 4.3.3.10 etc. and the numerical results shown i. fig. 4.3.1.1 for convective heat transfer (with the exception of thermal 1)uckling instability), the magnitide of the thermal stress increases with increasing component size. the primary reason for this effect is that in larger structures heat flow occurs over larger distances. the above effect is particularly pronounced for non-uniform heatir,.g (or cooling) of large structures, such as plates partially heated over much of its surface, as indicated by the recent study of stahn at al. (1980). these observations immediately suggest that if high thermal stress resistance is to be achieved, large monolithic ceramic structures should be avoided. whenever possible. instead, the dimensions of the components should be kept as small as possible. large structures, if required to meet other design objectives should consist of assemblies of smaller cumponents. in case of non-uniform heating or cooling, the structures should be segmented, such that the size of each segment is no greater than the size of the region over which the non-uniform heating or cool- ing occurs. this will result in a uniform heating over each segment. 112\\', \\'the same conclusion applies to the effect of size on the extent of crack propagation in severe thermal environments in which thermal stress fracture cannot be avoided. for a given number of cracks nucleated during failure, the extent of crack propagation is expected to be pro- portional to the volume of the component (hasselman 1970; gupta, 1972). decreasing component size will reduce the extent of crack propagation and increase the load-bearing capability following thermal stress fracture. secondly, as indicated by the various expressions presented earlier, the geometry of a structr re and/or component as well as the value of heat transfer also plays an important role in determining thermal stress resistance. no general rule can be given for the effect of geometry, but this effect allows the designer additional freedom in obtaining the maximum resistance to thermal stress failure. one specific example can be given. radially outward heat flow through the walls of a con- centric hollow cylinder will result in significantly lower values of the tensile thermal stresses than for radially inward heat flow. this is especially the case for cylinders, with wall thicknesses which are a significant fraction of the cylinder radii. the above conclusions with regard to the ffects of size and geometry, together with the effect of external constraints discussed previously, leads to the following design recovmndation: \"structures operatinji, in thermal environments with a high risk of thermal stress failure, whenever possible, should be constructed in •\\\\tthe form of assemblies of components (or sub-components) of small size sad simple geometry, to permit maximum free thermal expansion, minimum non-uniformity in heat transfer and minimum temperature non- uniformity within each component.\" 113\\', \\'designs proposed for point -focussing solar receivers, reviewed recently by ewing and zwissler, 1979. for instance, in the design proposed by m.i.t., it may be preferable to construct the dome -shaped heat -exchanger from a number of individual segments. the single monolithic dome of the current design may exhibit large tangential temperature non-uniformities, unless by careful design, the air -flow over the dome is distributed such that only the radial (through-the -thickness) temperature gradient exists. the same conclusion applies to the honey-comb heat exchanger in the design advanced by sanders associates. it is recommended that this heat exchanger be constructed of a number of parallel thin plates, rather than the monolithic design currently envisioned. for spatially non-uniform heating, these plates could be further segmented. similar consideration may apply to other components and designs advanced by other organizations. clearly, these recommendations are based on considerations which emphasize thermal stress failure. final designs should take into account all performance criteria. nevertheless, it is important to note that thermal stress failure cjp^a be minimized by careful design based on dimensional and geometric factors coupled with the selectl.cn of materials with optimum thermal stress resistance on the basis of the parameters presented in earlier sections of this report. 114\\', \\'7. recommendations for materials for point-focussing solar receivers 7.1. general the selection of materials of construction for point-focussing solar receivers should be based on a number of criteria. first of all, the material properties should be such that all design and performance standards are met. this applies not only to thermal shock, but also to other lead-bearing requirements, erosion, corrosion and optical properties. the relative importance of these criteria is expected to be governed by the final design. secondly, material selection should take into account availability and price. this criterion is critical to the timely development and demonstration of the technical and economic feasibility of point-focussing solar receivers. it is entirely conceivable that on the basis of hand- book or preliminary laboratory data, a particular material may appear very attractive indeed. however, usually for newly developed materials in- sufficient manufacturing experience and facilities exist. development programs for new ceramic materials are notorious for falling behind schedule due to unforeseen difficulties. in addition, development costs can exceed initial estimates by considerable margins. for this reason, it is strongly recommended that the construction of a point-focussing solar receiver not depend on the success or failure of new material de- velopment. instead, iz is urged that whenever possible, materials of construction be selected which are currently a •7ailable, even if this would require receiver operation at less than optimum efficiencies. once, feasibility is demonstrated, the performance standards can be improved further with a parallel or follow-up program of development of new materials. 1 0 \\\\t 115\\', \\'these recommendations not only apply to the choice of materials, but also to geometry and dimension. whenever possible, the final design of a point-focussing solar receiver should be based on components of a size and geometry for which or .naive manufacturing experience exists. this recommendation implies that with few exceptions the component size is small and that their geometry is relatively simple. it is anticipated that such components can be manufactured at minimum cost. 7.2. materials for individual components in view of these authors, the components of point-focussing solar receivers most susceptible to thermal shock failure are: a.window b.heat exchanger c.thermal insulators d.down-stream tubing or manifolds the material requirements for these four components are discussed below. the requirement of high melting point, oxidation resistance, erosion and corrosion resistance is common to all these components. the subsequent discussion will focus on the material requirements for fulfilling the basic function of the component as far as the operation of the solar receiver is concerned in combination with the requirements for thermal shock resistance. 7.2.1. the window a number of anticipated designs for point focussing receivers rely on the window in order to transmit the incident solar radiation into the chamber containing the heat exchanger and working fluid. since the working i .\\\\t 116\\', \"fluid is under some pressure, the high temperature mechanical properties of the window material should be such that no creep or fracture will result under normal operating conditions. in order to transmit the solar radiation at maximum efficiency, the window material should have low reflectivity and low absorption coefficient. high resistance to thermal shock failure requires a window material with high reflectivity and thermal conductivity in combination with low absorp- tion coefficient, coefficient of thermal expansion, young\\'s modulus of elasticity and poisson\\'s ratio. it should be noted that high reflectivity for high thermal stress resistance is incompatible with the low reflectivity required for maximum transmission of the solar radiation. also, all the above requirements may not be met within a single material. nevertheless, in spite of these conflicting requirements, fused quartz, in view of its very low coefficient of thermal expansion should be considered a prime candidate for the window material. thermal stress fracture, in view of these writers, is not likely to occur in this material. its absorption coefficient at wavelength greater than 4 um is greater than that for single crystal materials such as sapphire, rutile, magnesium oxide and other infra- red transmitting materials developed for aerospace and other purposes. for this reason, the temperature levels which could be encountered in windows made of fused quartz could be high which could lead to creep, dev±trification and corresponding loss of transmissivity. in that case, other materials such as sapphire or the other aforementioned material may provide superior service. on the ocher hand, the reflectivity of sapphire exceeds that of fused quartz, which is undesirable. also, much higher value of the coefficient of thermal expansion of sapphire compared to quartz is not favorable from the point of view of thermal stress resis- 117\", \\'m\\\\tr i lance. however, the higher thermal conductivity of sapphire than for fused quartz, at lower temperature levels will compensate for this latter deficiency. fused quartz, however, is considerably cheaper than any other window material. furthermore, excessive window temperatures can be reduced by flow patterns of the working fluid which will promote window cooling. external cooling may be used to advantage to reduce or eliminate the accumu- lation of dust which could adversely affect overall transmission of the incident radiation. if fused quartz were fo •.md to be unsuitable for a window material, other materials should be considered. these could include single or poly- crystals of alumina,titanium oxide, magnesium oxide, magnesium fluoride, calcium-alumina-germanate and similar materials currently being used or under investigation in aerospace industry. moat of these materials will ft transmit radiation over a wider range of wavelength than fused quartz. on the other hand, their coefficients of thermal expansion exceed the value for quartz by a considerable margin. for these reasons, it is ecommended that fused quartz be given high priority even if this would involve design modification to keep the window temperature within reasonable limits. regardless of the choice of material, it is recommended that the window be supported by sliding seals in order ro minimize in-plane and bending constraints. nickel oxide has been used to sliding seals in turbine regenerators and may prove to be useful in solar receivers as well. 7.2.2. heat exchanger and thermal insulator the purpose of the heat-exchanger in a solar receiver is to absorb the solar radiation. the absorbed heat is removed from the heat-exchanger by the working-fluid by forced convection. 118\\', \"in order to fulfill its basic function, the heat exchanger material should have low reflectivity (high absorptivity) and high absorption coefficient. furthermore, if the absorbed heat is to be conducted through the heat exchanger wall, high thermal conductivity is required in order to minimize the non-linearity of the temperature distribution and to keep the temperature of the irradiated face within reasonable limits. for high thermal stress resistance, the material of the heat exchanger should have high reflectivity, thermal conductivity and tensile strength in combination with low absorption coefficient, coefficient of thermal expansion, young\\'s modulus and poisson\\'s ratio. the requirement for low reflectivity and high absorption coefficient for high heat absorption is incompatible with the requirement for high reflectivity and low absorption coefficient required for good thermal shock resistance. clearly, the requirement for low reflectivity and high absorp- tion coefficient must be given priority in order to meet the performance criteria for the heat exchanger. fortunately, high thermal conductivity is required for high thermal stress resistance and high heat conduction. this latter requirement is imperative for the mit, al and black and veatch design. silicon carbide or silicon nitride probably are the best materials for consideration for these three designs. the relatively higher coefficient of thermal expansion and young\\'s modulus of silicon carbide is offset by its higher thermal conductivity compared to silicon nitride. the relatively low value for thermal conductivity for the cordierite ceramic considered for the exchanger in the nrl design may cause difficulty unless the wall thickness can be reduced appreciably. this may conflict with other structural 119\", \\'requirements. because of the complex configuration of the nrl heat exchanger, substitution of silicon carbide or silicon nitride for the cordierite may lead to manufacturing difficulties. the same will be true for other refractory materials with high thermal conductivity such as other nitrides, carbides or borides. as pointed out earlier, the writers of this report prefer a heat- exchanger design in which the heat is removed by the working fluid at the same surface on which the radiation is incident. for a given temperature level of the working fluid, this will involve such lower surface temperature than that in case where heat is removed on the opposite surface. this has the advantage that the requirement for melting-point and high tempera- ture structural integrity are less stringent. furthermore, heat losses by re-emitted radiation are also reduced. these advantages are incorporated in the heat exchanger design advanced by sanders associates, in which the working fluid is pumped through the heat-exchanger in the form of a honey-comb type structure. this type of configuration also will keep the reflectivity to a minimum. for this type of heat exchanger, cordierite of the type, identical or similar to that used for automotive exhaust catalyst support, appears to be an excellent candidate. its tempera- ture characteristics are deemed sufficient to withstand long-term opera- tion at temperatures approaching 1000 oc. furthermore, its coefficient of thermal expansion and effective elastic behavior are such that the problem of thermal shock failure can be minimized or even eliminated by appropriate design. also, because of its extremely low cost and easy availability, cordierite honey-comb heat exchangers can be readily replaced if some form of degradation should still occur. it should be noted that thermal shock failure of cordierite honey-comb structure is still a matter of concern in the automotive industry. however, in the latter application the thermal 120\\', \\'i shock problem is magnified because of uneven heating as the direct result of the differences in dimansiovs of the exhaust manifold and container for the catalyst support. in comparison,the radiation heat flux on the heat exchanger in the sanders design is expected to be more uniform. furthermore, as discussed earlier, by appropriate segmenting of the honey-comb receiver, the problem of thermal shock failure, if any, can be reduced even further. if the cordierite would be found unsuitable due to loss of structural integrity at high temperature, honey-comb structures of reaction-sintered silicon nitride or silicon carbide should be considered. the technology for the manufacture of silicon nitride honey-comb material is well established. however, the thermal shock resistance of reaction sintered silicor nitride may well be less than for cordierite. if so, a change in geometry of the heat exchanger may be in order. the configuration of packed spheres, chosen by general motors for its automotive catalyst system possibly may be used to advantage. such a bed of packed spheres will permit easy passage of the working fluid. at the same time, thermal shock failure, due to the absence of mechanical constraints between spheres, will not be a problem. thermal stress failure due to non-uniform temperatures within each sphere can be eliminated by appropriate selection of the sphere size. one half inch spheres (or less) should eliminate thermal stress failure in any ceramic which may be chosen. a similar configura- tion of spheres could be considered for the ceramic heat storage buffer incorporated in the sanders design. also, the use of small interl-3cking hexagonal ceramic blocks of alumina, magnesia and zirconia used in air•- preheaters for wind-tunnels and mhd power systems should not be ruled out. the relative thermal shock resistance of insulating; refractory mate- rials frequently is designated by the manufacturer so \"poor\", \"good\" or eili\\', \\'\"excellent\". it should be noted that for such material with few exceptions, thermal shock resistance is based on the \"crack arrest\" concept, discussed in detail in an earlier section of this report. refractory fibrous silica or alumino-silicate insulating materials also can be used to advantage in some areas of solar receivers. such materials in the form of sheet or rope can be used to reduce heat losses through gaps or spaces between components required for maximum free thermal expansion. such fibrous materials are readily available at low cost from a number of suppliers. 7.2.3. down-stream components components, down-stream from the heat exchanger, such as manifolds and piping required to transfer the working fluid to the turbine, will be sub- jected to transient as well as steady-state non-uniformity in temperature. such non-uniform temperature could give rise to thermal stress of high magni- tude to result in immediate failure or failure by thermal fatigue. hopefully, the temperature levels and pressure encountered will permit refractory metals or alloys for their construction. if not, reaction sintered silicon nitride or silicon carbide appears to offer a combination of properties suitable for this purpose. also, these materials can be manufactured in relatively complex shapes (manifold& or other) down-stream components are expected to take. even then, it is strongly recommended that their geometry be kept as simple as possible and the size also be kept to a minimum. 7.3. final remarks much relevant information for the selection of materials can be ob- tained once a final design or designs are selected and detailed temperature and stress analyses have been carried out. the finite element modelling •\\\\t 122\\', \\'should be of major benefit for this purpose. also, rapid feed-back on material behavior will be provided by the experimental thermal shock test- ing program outlined later, which should pinpoint unforeseen diffi- culties and/or particular material requirements. with such data in hand, assessment can be made for the need for ra-design, material modification or the development of novel material not available at this time. 123\\', \\'6.1. general engineering design and selection of materials for high-temperatures in general and solar receivers in particular can benefit considerably from advance information on the performance of the components under con- ditions of thermal shock. such information can be established by testing the thermal shock behavior by experimental techniques. many methods for testing the thermal shock response of ceramic materials have been developed. thermal stress resistance under conditions of steady-state heat flow or controlled heating can be established by the internal heating of hollow cylinders (coble and kingery, 1955; hummel, 1955; gogotsi and groushevsky, 1980). thermal stress failure under condi- tions of transient convective heat transfer can be established by quenching specimens in the form of cylinder or other geometry, from higher temperature into fluid media at lower temperature, such as water, molten salts, liquid metals, oils or fluidized beds (crandall and ging, 1955; hasselman, 1970; king and webb, 1971; kirchner at al, 1968, 1971, 1973 and hasselman, at al., 1975). rapid convective cooling can also be achieved by air-blasts, frequently used for studies of thermal fatigue behavior, (aaasaann at al., 1976, quinn at al., 1977). thermal shock response to black-body radiation can be determined by \"up-quenching\" appropriate specimens at a low temperature into a black-body cavity (furnace) at high temperature (crandall and ging, 1955; hasselman and shaffer, 1962; hasselman, 1963). other methods for inducing thermal shock include plasma-heating, arc-discharge heating, laser- heating, induction heating and burner-rigs (starret, 1977; johnson, 1974; sato, et al., 1980; schwille, at al., 1980; mecholsky, at al., 1980). 124\\', \\'numerous other testing methods have been developed for many spacial indus- trial and consumer products susceptible to thermal stress failure under the conditions of their intended application. from the results presented in previous sections of this report, it should be clear to the reader that the saterial properties and other variables such as geometry and size, which affect thermal stress failure can vary significantly from one thermal anvirunment to another. this conclusion also applies to the various methods for thermal shock testing. results obtained under conditions of steady-state heat flow are not appropriate to transient heating. the results for tests which rely on radiation heat transfer are not expected to reflect results to be obtained for convective heat transfer. (in this respect it should be noted that convective heat transfer coefficients are highly variable, such that results of tests which rely on this mechanism of heat transfer, are difficult to interpret for quantitative purposes). furthermore, results for thermal shock tests in- volving external constraints will not apply to thermal shock environments in which such constraints are absent. even for the same test method re- sults obtained for one level of average temperature may differ significantly from the results obtained at some other test temperature. this conclusion also applies to differences in geometry as well as specimen size. for these reasons, attempts to \"infer\" thermal shock behavior for a given thermal environment from test data obtained for some other environment is not expected to yield reliable results. in particular, this will be the case of major differences in mechanisms of heat transfer and complex geometries for which the magnitude and distribution of the temperatures and thermal stresses are not readily obtainable. s\\\\t125\\', \\'the above discussion is critical to the selection of the most ap- propriate test method for the thermal shock behavior of materials or com- ponents for solar receivers in order to yield quantitatively meaningful results for the designer. for this reason, such a test should simulate as closely as possible the thermal shock environment to be encountered in solar receivers. this applies not only to the magnitudes of tempera- tures and stresses but also to the combined radiation heating-convection cooling conditions and specimen size and geometry as well. specific recommendations for a thermal shock testing program for point-focus solar receivers must await final selection of the design expected to yield most efficient and reliable operation and for which estimates or data for the heat transfer characteristics are available. for these; reasons, a number of general recommendations for the thermal shock teat facilities and procedures will be made at this time. 8.2. thermal shock test facilities and procedures the following recommendations are made for the type and scope of the thermal shock test facilities and testing procedures. 1. the components of the solar receiver directly subjected to the incident solar radiation probably are soot susceptible to thermal stress failure. the spectral distribution of solar radiation say be difficult to duplicate by radiation from lasers, plasma-torches or other intense light sources. furthermore, each candidate material has its own unique spectral dependence of its pertinent material properties. for these reasons, it is recommended that a thermal shock test facility use solar radiation itself, concentrated by parabolic mirrors or by other techniques. 126\\', \\'2.the solar-radiation thermal shock test facility should be designed to permit control over the intensity of the radiation incident on the component being tested. by varying the position of the component to be tested with respect to the focal plane, the radiation intet.: 4ty is varied easily even for constant solar flux at the mirror surface. lateral movement within the focal plane will permit testing the affect of spatially non-uniform incident radiation. both these latter objectives can be achieved by partial screening, as well. 3.the thermal shock test facility should be designed such as to include capability for convective cooling in order to simulate the combina- tion of radiation heating and convective cooling encountered within tha solar receiver. the geometry of the manifold, air flaw velocities and distribution should be such that the, spatial variation in heat transfer coefficient found within the solar receiver are duplicated as closely as possible. 4.control over the radiation should be such that variations in the radiation intensity expected during intermittent cloud cover or other conditions can be closely duplicated. s. the convective cooling system shoula permit control over flow speeds and pressure in order to simulate unusual operating conditions such as loss of compressor power due to electrical or mechanical breakdown. 5.the thermal shock test facility should be instrumented as com- pletely as possible to detect and record all pertinent operational variables such as radiation intensity, air flow speeds and pressures, as well as temperatures and deformations. acoustic spectrometers will permit detection of the fatigue phenomena or the onset of failure. 127\\', \\'?. the fixture which holds the component(s) to be tested, should permit tasting of components, singly or in combination in order to establish thermal interactions and possible effects of mutual constraints. in this ssnner, a window or a taceiver could be tested individually or in combination. this permits assessment of the effects of window absorption and reflection on the thermal shock behavior of the receiver and the effect , of reflection of the incident radiation as well as thermal emission from the receiver plate on the thermal shock behavior of the window. s. the radiation thermal shock test facility should permit thermal shock testing of down-stream components not directly subjected to the solar radia- tion, but subjected to thermal stresses during normal or special operat- ing conditions of the solar receivers. if desired, a complete alternative test facility could be constructed for testing of down-stream components. however, the thermal conditions expected in practice, can be duplicated most easily and closely by the solar radiation thermal shock test facility itself. 9.all components to be tested should be subjected to a thorough quality control chuck, in order to detect dsiects or other irregularities which could affect the test results. records of all such defects should be kept carefully in order to facilitate analysis of the -vt results. 10.first stages of the test program should concentrate on thermal shock tests duplicating conditions to be encountered in practice. radia- tion levels required to initiate failure should be measured and compared to radiation levels to be expected in practice. a comparison of these values will allow assessing the direction of design modification such as 128\\', \\'modification in radiation intensities and convection cooling rates, com- ponent geometry and size or selection and development of alternative mate- rials with improved thermal shock behavior. later stages of the testing program should include unusual thermal shock conditions such as sudden incident radiation in the absence of air- flow or steady-state radiation with sudden loss of airflow and similar emergency condit! .-r s. 11.after testing, each component should be examined as thoroughly as possible for possible failure. for some materials it is expected that failure is catastrophic, the component falling apart spontaneously on removal from the test facility. cracks in brittle ceramics are not easily detected with unaided eye. for this reason any tested component should be examined in detail using dye-penetrant, ultrasonic or other non-des- tructive test methods for the presence of cracks. macrophotography and microfractography of fractured samples will provide permanent records as well as the vital information on the mode of failure, the site of fracture initiation and the magnitude of stress at which failure occurred. this latter information will provide important feed-back informat.ton for the validity of the assumptions made for the calculations of the thermal stresses, as well as provide directions for design modification and selec- tion or development of alternative materials of construction. 12.a final, but critical comment on thermal shock testing is in order. from the above recommendations, it is clear that the thermal shock test facility and program should be similar or even duplicate the design and testing programs for a prototype solar receiver. at first sight, such a test facility and program may be judged as too complex and uneconomi- cal. for this reason, it could be tempting to resort to simplified testing 129\\', \"methods or even to rely on manufacturer\\'s data for thermal shock be- havior. this approach is not recommended. however, by means of techno- logy of which these writers may not be aware, other radiation sources can be found which duplicates the nature and magnitude of the thermal shock environment encountered in a solar receiver. the design of such a test using other than solar radiation is expected to be difficult or impossible. any other test methods may not yield data which are quan- titatively meaningful for design purposes, but in fact may provide data that are erroneous and misleading for solar receivers. \\\\tfor these reasons, it is suggested that if the recommended test facility is not feasible on technical, economic or other grounds, the testing should be avoided altogether. instead, therm grl shock behavior should be calculated from the material property data and best estimates for the heat transfer environments. 8.3 theoretical analysis in support of experimental thermal shock testing program as indicated in section 4 of this report, thermal stress failure of brittle ceramics is controlled by a large number of variables, including material properties, geometric, size and heat transfer effects. for this reason, the interpretation of experimental data for thermal shock can be quite complex. this is especially the case for complex geometries sub- jected to mixed-mode of heat transfer conditions for which the temperatures and thermal stresses are not easily established. without this information, experimental data for thermal shock behavior may provide little or no guidance for the direction in which design or material improvements are to be made. therefore, it is strongly recommended tnat the experimental program for the thermal shock behavior, be supported by a theoretical 130\", \\'effort of calculating magnitudes and distributions of the temperatures and thermal stresses by computer simulation. these calculations can be based on analytical methods, whenever practical. preferably, such calculations should be based cm finite difference or finite element principles, because of their much greater flexibility than analytical methods. a number of benef:.ts can be derived from an experimental and parallel analytical program on assessing thermal stress resistance. comparisons a_° the experimental. and theoretical data for the temperature distribution will provide valuable feed-back for the validity of the assumptions made with regard to heat transfer mechanisms and magnitudes of the heat trans- fer properties of the component being tested. the reliability of the thermal stress calculations and predicted failure mode will be improved accordingly. a further major advantage is that computer .simulation can provide rapid information on the degree of improvement obtained by changing the material, component size and shape, incident solar radiation intensity as well as pressure and flow rates of the working-fluid. costly , and time-consuming test programs can be avoided or reduced to a minimum. the effects of unusual operating conditions, not easily duplicated in a test facility, can also be assessed easily by computer simulation. in general, such supporting theoretical analyses should reduce the cost of an experimental thermal shock testing program to a minimum. this should, consequently, lead to a reduction in the total cost and duration of the development program of solar receivers. b 131\\', \\'9. materials-related comments and recommendations for system design and operation the conclusions obtained in this study have a number of implications for the design and operation of point-focussing solar receivers. un- doubtedly, these already have been considered in design studies carried \\\\t i in parallel with the present program. although clearly beyond the scope of this report, these implications must be listed as they are related directly to materials performance. first of all the design of the receiver and its control equipment must be such that under no condition the solar pnergy will be directed at the heat exchanger without adequate flow of the workcj^ng fluid. if such flow and corresponding cooling is not provided, the heat exchanger will reach temperatures well in excess of the melting point of most, if not all, candidate materials of construction. this recommendation implies that an external power source be provided (not powered by solar energy) which can circulate the working fluid prior to the incidence of the solar radiation. it is anticipated that this may require rapidly acting sensing and control devices which govern the working-fluid flow and/or the orientation of the focussing mirror. secondly, the theoretical results for the thermal stresses in the semi-absorbing plates indicate that the transient stresses are an in- verse function of the heat transfer coefficient. for this reason it is recommended that on start-up, the rate of circulation of the working- fluid be greater than required for steady-state operation. for the same reason it may be desirable to reduce the rate of flow on reduction in solar intensity in order to reduce the cooling rates and the magnitude of the 132\\', \\'corresponding thermal stress. here too, automatic sensing and control devices are expected to be useful. a further highly speculative recommendation will be made aimed at elimination or reduction of excessive heating and cooling rates and the distribution difficulties encountered in the utility industry by rapid iriations in power-output such as those expected for intermittent cloud-covers. such variation may require stand-by power-generating units such as pumped-storage or other systems in order to assure an uninter- rupted power supply. it is suggested here that such difficulties can be overcome by using a hybrid-system such as a combination of a solar re- ceiver and a gas-turbine generator or other power generating systems. for instance, the sanders design could be modified slightly to permit the introduction of natural gas into the cavity between the window and the heat exchanger. combustion could be achieved within the heat ex- changer with the aid of the appropriate catalyst. this latter techno- logy is well developed. the amount of gas to be introduced would de- pend on the intensity of the incident radiation. in this manner, tem- perature levels could be maintained within prescribed tolerances. furthermore variations in power output could be kept to a minimum. such a hybrid system could be described as turbine-assisted solar re- ceiver or a solar-augmented gas-turbine. undoubtedly other such hy- brid systems relying on other methods of power generation, depending on fuel availability and location, can be devised as well. 133\\', \\'10. recomiendations for future analytical work to aid materials selection for solar receivers this report has presented criteria for the selection of ceramic materials, which are currently available in the technical literature. however, for at least two conditions of possible thermal stress failure unique to solar receivers, analyses are required for purposes of material selection, design and possible failure prediction. these studies recommended for follow-on work are: 1.an extension of the thermal stress analysis of semi—absorbing ceramics to include the spectral dependence of the relevant optical properties to correspond to the spectral distribution of solar radia- tion. 2.analysis of thermal stresses which occur in semi-absorbing ceramic materials, initially at thermal equilibrium under conditions of rada- tion heating and convection cooling, subjected to sudden loss of radiation, followed by rapid convection cooling. this type of thermal- shock is expected to occur frequently in solar receivers. it is essential that the role of the pertinent material properties must be established in order to properly assess the criteria for materials selection and interpretation of failure modes. 134\\', \\'summary an analysis was conducted of the possiua modes of thermal stress failure of brittle ceramics for potential use in point-focussing solar receivers. the pertinent material properties which control thermal stress resistance were identified for conditions of steady-state aid transient heat flow, convective and radiative heat transfer, thermal buckling and thermal fatigue as well as catastrophic crack propagation. selection rules for materials with optimum thermal stress resistance for a parti- cular thermal environment were identified. recommendations for materials for particular components were made. the general requirements for a thermal shock testing program quantitatively meaningful for point-focus- sing solar receivers were outlined. recommendations for follow-on theoretical analyses were made. 135\\', \\'references c. l. ammann, j. e. doherty and c. g. nessler,

 some 30 years sooner, the sps demonstration satellite will have served its initial  purpose. the demonstration satellite represents a somewhat similar, albeit  considerably smaller, resource.  to the extent to which there develops a demand for energy, sps-like  subsystems and raw materials in space, one can expect that sps will derive some  salvage value. if, on the other hand, no such demand develops, the sps satellite will  have to be removed from geosynchronous orbit (ceo), either for storage and \\', \\'2  possible later salvage use or for permanent disposal. in this case it is important to  have estimates of the cost of sps satellite disposal.  the objectives of this study are to find potential salvage uses for. both the  sps demonstration and full-scale satellites, to determine the satellite salvage  values for each potential use, to prioritize these uses in order to determine likely  salvage value per satellite as a fraction of satellite capital cost and to determine  the cost of disposal for unsalvaged satellites or portions thereof.  1.1 background  the salvage uses and values and disposal costs estimated in this study are  based on the rockwell international sps satellite configuration and development  program. the basic satellite configuration is shown in figure 1.1 and its major  pnysical characteristics are provided in table 1.1. the satellite uses gallium  aluminum arsenide solar cells with a concentration ratio of 2 and a graphite  composite structure.  source : satellite  power systems (sps)  concept definition’  study, executive  summ4ry, ssd 79-0010-  1, rockwell inter-  national, downey, ca,  march 1979.  figure 1.1 reference satellite configuration \\', \\'table 1.1 reference satellite ctwmcteristlcs*  .;==----- =_  ys generation capability (utility 5 gu  interface)  over&l dimnsions (kl’l)  satellite ms (kc)  coyer conversion-photovoltaic  structire material  construction location  transportation  l earth-to-leo -cargo  (payload)  -personnel  (number)  l leo-to-ge0 -cargo  -personnel  (nupiber) 5.3 x 10.4  34 x 105  halas (cr = 2)  graphite composite (gfrtp)  6eo  vertical takeoff. yin6eo 2-stage  (424,000 kg)  cldoified shuttle  (75)  dedicated elect. otv  2-stage lox/lh2  (75)  microwave poker transmission  0 n0. of antennas 1  l antenna pointing/control control went gyros (cmgs)  l dc-rf converter klystron  l fre’jjency (gh) 2.45  l rectenna di=nsions (km) 10 x 13  l rectewa power density  wcl?‘)  -center 23  -edge 1  l sdurce : satellite power systems (sps) concept definition study,  executive sibwry. ssd 79-0010-l. rdckyell international. mu-  ney. ca. wch 1979.  the development and implementation program for this satellite calls for  deployment of a geosynchronous demonstration satellite, with a power generation  capability of 335 mw at beginning of life, early in the year 1999. shortly  thereafter, the demonstration satellite is grown into a full-scale satellite with a  generation capability (in space) of 9.53 cw (8.92 gw power into the microwave  antenna). the first full-scale sps satellite becomes operational late in the year  2000. following the first full-scale sps, the reference program calls for bringing  two 5 cw systems on line each year, beginning in the year 2001, until a total of 60  systems, 300 gw capacity, are installed. \\', \\'4  using the above program plan, the demonstration satellite becomes available  for salvage early in the year 2000 and full-scale sps satellites become available for  salvage at the rate of two per year beginning late in the year 2030. concurrent  with the full-scale satellites, the rectenna also becomes available for salvage. it is  possible that the rectenna will be used for a subsequent sps if the program  continues. if this is the case, some amount of refurbishment may be necessary  and/or desirable, thus allowing evolutionary changes in the satellite portion of the  system, such as beam power density, beam shape and size, frequency and  polarization. in any event, rectenna reuse may be considered to be a salvage use.  figure 1.2 shows the amount of sps materials which will have become available for  salvage as a function of time.  the utilization of geosynchronous orbit in the post-2000 time period is likely  to be quite intense. thus it is likely that any structures or satellites that are  placed in this orbit will have to be removed upon completion of their useful life.  accordingly, any unsalvaged sps-related structures, facilities or satellites will  have to be disposed of at the end of their useful life.  1.2 approach  it is clear from figure 1.2 that all salvage and disposal activities will occur in  the post-2000 time period. salvage or disposal of the demonstration satellite will  occur somewhere in the 2000 to 2010 time period; salvage or disposal of full-scale  satellites will begin sometime after 2030 and continue at least through 2060. in  order to make any estimates of salvage uses and salvage values, it is necessary to  place the potential salvage activities into the context of a space program. thus it  is necessary first to establish a mission model for the period 2000 to 2060 as a basis  for analysis. obviously any such mission model will suffer from major uncertain-  ties and, in the end, one can identify only certain long-term trends without  becoming specific about particular missions. \\', \\'1.0  0.5  0  300  200 misc.  k+p$!!  ui a s  aluminum  sapphire  copper  stainless  steel  gfrtp  2000 2030 2040 2050  calendar year  (a) cumulative salvageable mass 2060  2000 2030 2040 2050 2060  calendar year  (b) cumulative salvageable generation capacity  figure 1,.2 salvageable sps mass and generation capacity \\', \\'6  the generic trends which one can identify today that are likely to carry over  into the 21st century include mainly an t’industrialization” of space; that is, a  gradual transition from government-funded activities primarily of a research  nature to activities promoted and conducted in the private sector because they are  profitable. it is likely that these activities will be encouraged by significant  reductions in the cost of space-based activities resulting from a transition to the  space shuttle and more advanced space transportation systems, and by the  introduction and proliferation of multipurpose platforms.  much of the activity in space in the post-2000 time period will take place in  geosynchronous orbit. this activity is likely to generate a considerable amount of  low earth orbit (leo) to ge0 traffic, independent of sps. there is also likely to  be considerable other geocentric traffic, however, including leo to geo, ge0 to  ge0 and lunar traffic, as well as earth escape traffic. within the context of these  space activities, potential salvage uses for both the sps demonstration satellite  and full-scale sps satellites were identified and evaluated.  it is not clear today that the sps demonstration will be a success; that is,  that upon completion of the demonstration satellite project, it will be found  desirable to proceed with construction of full-scale sps satellites as planned. (if it  were known today that the demonstration would be successful, it would be  unnecessary.) thus salvage uses of the demonstration satellite need to recognize  that there may or may not be a continuing sps program.  on the other hand, salvage of full-scale sps satellites will occur only if there  is an sps program and, consequently, the salvage uses for full-scale sps satellites  are appropriately identified in the context of a space program which includes sps.  such a program clearly requires a space transportation system that can inexpen-  sively transport large amounts of materials to geocentric space, and it includes \\', \\'7  capabilities in large space structures, space-based construction, manned leo and  ceo facilities, and so on. these capabilities infer such space-based activities as  space manufacturing, the utilization of large applications platforms, lunar explora-  tion and exploitation, and physics and astronomy.  the above space-based activities lead to identification of the following  potential salvage uses:  demonstration satellite  0 growth into full-scale sps satellite (rockwell international reference  program plan, applicable only if the demonstration is successful)  0 use .as a source of power for other space activities such as ceo  platforms, a manufacturing base or an electric orbit transfer vehicle  0 use as a power supply for a laser space transportation system  0 use as a source of raw material.  full-scale sps satellites  0 use as spares and materials for other sps satellites  0 use as a power supply and platform for other space activities such as  platforms, a manufacturing base, a lunar base or space habitats  0 use as. a power supply for laser transportation systems including  geocentric space, especially leo to ceo, earth escape and aircraft on  oceanic routes  0 use as a power supply to recover amor and apollo asteriods  0 use as a power supply for a high-energy, high-vacuum physics labora-  tory in space.  next, the salvage value of the sps satellites was estimated for most of the  above potential uses. in all cases the salvage value is taken to be the present  value of the cost savings afforded by the salvage use referenced to the initial  operation date of the salvaged article. the discount rate used throughout this  study is a real (i.e., inflationary effects removed) rate of 4 percent. thus, the  salvage values presented represent the effective amount by which the capital cost \\', \\'8  of the satellite is reduced because it will provide a positive net salvage value. the  present value of sps revenue requirements, reflected in the sps charge’ rates, may  accordingly be reduced by this amount. for example, if it is found that the salvage  value of an sps satellite is equal to ten percent of the capital cost of the satellite,  then the annual capital carrying charge for the satellite, for purposes of com-  parison to alternative systems, may be reduced by ten percent.  any sps satellites or portions thereof which are not salvaged will, in all  likelihood, have to be removed from geosynchronous orbit. an objective of this  study is to estimate sps satellite disposal costs. to do this a number of disposal  alternatives were identified, the velocity requirements for each were estimated  and then the costs of each were determined. sps disposal costs include four  major cost categories: cost of propellant, cost of transporting the propellant to  ceo, cost of modifying the sps satellite as necessary (mainly installation of  thrusters, tankage and controls) and the cost of mission operations. cost  estimates provided are based on the assumption that the satellite is disposed of  intact.  wherever possible cost estimates used in this study were derived from the  sps concept definition study performed by rockwell international,* and are in  1977 dollars, consistent with this report. thus while these cost estimates contain  considerable uncertainty, the variation in estimates of salvage value and disposal  costs are likely to approximate the variations in satellite captial costs. hence the  estimates provided can be taken to be relatively firm when viewed in comparison  to the capital cost estimates.  7  satellite power systems (sps) concept definition study, system engineering,  part 2 (cost and programmatics, rockwell international report no. ssd 79-  0010-2-2, march 1979. \\', \\'9  1.3 results  discussion of the results is appropriately divided into four parts: salvage  value for potential salvage uses of the demonstration satellite, salvage -value for  potential salvage uses of full-scale sps satellites, salvage value of rectennae and  disposal costs for the demonstration and full-scale satellites. the major study  results are summarized in table 1.2.  two principal salvage uses for the demonstration satellite are apparent:  growth to a full-scale satellite and use as a power supply for a laser space  transportation system. obviously, the former use applies only if the demonstration  program is a success; that is, if it is found desirable to continue the sps program  beyond the demonstration phase. if this salvage use is implemented, the salvage  value of the demonstration satellite is about 80 percent of the on-orbit cost of the  salvageable hardware. since almost all of the demonstration satellite is salvage-  able (except perhaps the ion thrusters and associated systems used to transport it  from leo to geo), one can take the salvage value to be essentially 80 percent of  the on-orbit cost of the demonstration satellite. the reason that the salvage value  of the demonstration satellite is not 100 percent of its cost is because of the time  value of money (discounting) and the time delay between investment in the  demonstration satellite and start of construction of the full-scale satellite.  the second principal salvage use of the demonstration satellite, use as a  power source for a laser space transportation system, is a viable salvage use  whether the demonstration program is a success or not. the salvage value for this  use derives mainly from cost savings in the cost of transporting chemical  propellants from earth to leo for use in leo to ceo transportation of personnel  and logistics. the considerably higher specific impulse of a laser rocket permits  about a 70 percent reduction in the mass of propellant that must be transported to \\', \"potential demand  potential salvage use salvage value for salvage use remarks  demmstratdm satellite  l grouth to full-scale  l

availability of a multi-loo.mw power  supply enables laser rocket transfer times from leo to ceo to be quite  comparable to chemical rocket transfer times.  the value of a laser space transportation system is clearly dependent upon  the amount of leo to ge0 and other geocentric space traffic. if the sps program  does not proceed beyond the demonstration phase, the bulk of the geocentric  traffic will be in support of geosynchronous platforms, providing the salvage value  shown in table 1.2. if the sps program continues into an operational phase,  however, the value of a laser space transportation system is substantially greater.  particularly with a continuing sps program, the laser space transportation system  appears so attractive that it is likely that it will be developed and used independent  of what.is done with the demonstration satellite.  many potential salvage uses of substantial value exist for full-scale sps  satellites. their value, however, is very uncertain due to the fact that these uses  occur 50 to 80 years in the future. the uses which appear to be most attractive  include laser transportation systems, both space-to-space and for aircraft on  oceanic routes, as a power supply to recover amor and apollo asteroids and,  although not quantitatively evaluated, as a power supply for a high-energy,  high-vacuum physics laboratory in space. it is conceivable that these uses, plus  other less exciting salvage uses such as power for a space manufacturing base or  space habitat, could provide sufficient demand for salvage use of an entire fleet of  60 5cw sps satellites.  the sps rectennae will most likely all be salvaged. the salvage will include  recovery of steel and aluminum which have a combined value of about $290 million  (at current prices) less removal cost plus recovery of the land. taking the removal  cost to be 25 percent of value (and adding discounting) the net salvage value of \\', \\'12  these materials would be about $67 million. it is likely, however, that the cost of.  removing the concrete for recovery of the land would be approximately equal to the  net value of the steel and aluminum. thus the principal salvage value of the  rectennae is likely to be the present value of the land referenced to the initial  operation date of the system. this is approximately $33 million* at a land value of  about $1,000 per acre.  a more valuable salvage use of the rectennae would be their reuse with new  sps satellites. in this case, especially if existing concrete footings and other  components are reusable, the salvage value of the rectennae could approach  30 percent of their new cost. since the rectennae cost represents about 26 percent  of the total sps cost of about $13.9 billion, this value could approach $1.1 billion.  if only land and the rectenna support structures are salvageable, the salvage value  is about $620 million. this lower number allows substantial evolution to occur in  the rectenna technology.  finally; those items which are not salvaged must be disposed of. the disposal  options considered and their respective costs are given in table 1.3. five disposal  options are considered. disposal to l4 or lg, the stable (equilateral) libration  points in the earth-moon system would provide a location where the satellites  might be recovered at some point in the distant future and salvaged for some,  presently unknown, use. no stationkeeping or control of the satellites would be  necessary once they are in this orbit. the second disposal option presented is to  boost the satellite to an orbit above geo. twice ge0 is presented arbitrarily.  the av required is obviously a function of how high the satellite is boosted and the  value provided is nominal. this orbit

(once every 1000 years, for  example, depending on requirements).  the third and fourth options dispose of the satellite forever by removing it  from geocentric space. these could be desirable options if it becomes important to  assure that no future concern need be given to the satellite.  the final disposal option, earth reentry, is probably the least desirable from  not only the aspect of cost --it requires the highest velocity increment--but from  environmental and risk concerns as well. this disposal mode is unlikely to be  implemented.  1.4 conclusions and recommendations  the conclusions and recommendations with respect to the demonstration  satellite are as follows. the preferred salvage use is to use the demonstration  satellite as a power source for a laser space transportation system. this will  require installation of a laser power transmitter on the satellite. accordingly it is  recommended that the demonstration satellite be equipped with both a microwave \\', \\'14 .  power transmitter and a laser power transmitter and be used to demonstrate both  sps configurations. upon completion of the demonstration, the microwave power  transmission system could be salvaged for use on a full-scale sps satellite if the  microwave sps option is found desirable. the demonstration vehicle, however,  ,would remain in ge0 and, using the laser power transmission system, power laser  rockets for leo to ceo transportation.  the value of the recommended salvage use is strongly dependent on the  continuation of the sps program, but even in the absence of a continuing sps  program, it appears sufficient to justify the development of a laser space transpor-  tation system exclusive of the sps demonstration project. for planning purposes  it is reasonable to assume that this salvage use will offset about 80 percent of the  on-orbit cost of the demonstration satellite hardware.  the conclusions and recommendations with respect to the full-scale satellites  are as follows. several potential salvage uses exist for full-scale sps satellites,  each with a salvage value ranging up to about $3 billion. preferred salvage uses  appear to be use as a power supply for a laser space transportation system, use as a  power supply for powering aircraft on oceanic routes, use as a power supply to  recover amor and apollo asteroids and use as a power supply for a high-energy,  high-vacuum physics laboratory in space.  the average salvage value of an sps satellite appears to be in the range of 5  to 10 percent of the satellite capital cost or about $500 million to $1 billion. some  specific uses, however, may provide significantly higher salvage values, but they  are likely to be limited to only a few satellites.  a basic theme which seems to dominate the salvage value results is that the  uses which utilize the entire satellite intact have a higher value than those  which require segmenting the satellite. the more the satellite is cut up, the less it  appears to be worth as salvage. \\', \\'in any event, if it becomes necessary to dispose of sps satellites, a number of  disposal options appear feasible. the cost of disposal is on the order of  $100 million. this amount has a present value referenced to the initial -operation  date of the satellite of about $30 million or only about 0.3 percent of the capital  investment cost of the satellite.  it is clear from the above analysis that an assumption of zero net salvage and  disposal cost for the sps satellites is conservative. a less conservative assump-  tion, for purposes of comparing sps to alternative systems, would be to take a net  salvage value between 5 and 10 percent of satellite capital investment cost.  1.5 backup documentation  the remaining sections of this report provide backup documentation to the  results shown above. both in review of the backup documentation and interpreta-  tion of the above results, the reader should keep in mind that the analyses and  results presented here are based upon long-range projections of space and other  activities and thus contain considerable uncertainty. \\', \\'16  2. a post-2000 mission model  oscar morgenstern once said, “predicting things is very difficult, especially  the future.” yet, if one is to establish the salvage value of sps demonstration and  full-scale satellites, one must describe the environment within which these  satellites are salvaged. at the very least, this means identifying a space mission  model for the time period during which the salvage operation will take place.  basically this time period may be divided into two parts: the years 2000 to 2030  during which time the principal object of salvage is the sps demonstration  satellite; and the period 2030 to 2060, and possibly beyond, when full-scale sps  satellites would become available for salvage.  to begin with, one should recognize that these time frames, at least in terms  of specific economic projections, are quite far in the future. the earlier time  frame begins 20 years from now and spans a period of 30 years, ending half a  century from today. the second period, beginning in the year 2030, is a period of  projection that is one-half a century and more in the future. on the scale of life of  five-year and ten-year plans, and of long-range planning that does not go beyond the  end of the 20th century, it is, for all practical purposes, impossible to develop a  mission model containing specific space missions. rather, over the period 2000 to  2030, projections of space activities are highly uncertain, although there is some  hope to identify and establish general trends. these trends can be identified on the  basis of existing technologies and technology projections for the relatively near  term. for example, an operational space transportation system based on the space  shuttle and advanced shuttle derivatives is likely to lead to reduced costs for space  activities and, subsequently, to an increasing level of commercial business in space. \\', \\'17  furthermore, there is some hope for identifying the major directions which this  “industrialization of space” will take.  beyond the year 2030, however, one’s ability to project even general trends  diminishes greatly. a fifty-year period is sufficient for major new and totally  unforeseen technologies to develop and become commercialized. without specific  knowledge of these technologies (and that knowledge cannot be had today),  projections of post-2030 space activities are entirely speculative. it is with the  above qualifications that the following projections of future space activities are  made. the first steps in making a long-range projection of space activities is to  determine where the impetus for such activities will arise. at the present time  funding for space activities derives almost entirely from national governments;  principally the u.s. and u.s.s.r. u.s. federal government expenditures on space,  spanning both dod and nasa, encompass about $6 billion for fy 1980.* looking  at free world activities and taking this $6 billion to be a measure of free world  government sponsorship of space activities and assuming, furthermore, that at the  very most this government sponsorship is unlikely to accelerate at a real rate of  growth greater than 3 percent per year, one sees a potential level of government-  sponsored activitiy in space by the year 2060 of only some ten times larger, or $60  billion per year (1980 $1, than the present amount. a space program sponsored only  by nasa and dod (assuming that they exist in the year 2060) at the level of $60  billion per year could possibly support some salvage activities on sps satellites, but  they would be severely limited.  it is highly unlikely, however, that one would be faced with the problem of  salvaging sps satellites in a space program that is principally funded by nasa and  dod, and to a lesser extent by other governments. the simple fact is that one  *the budget of the united states government, fiscal year 1980. \\', \\'18  would not be concerned about salvage of sps satellites unless an sps program is  indeed implemented. furthermore the presence of an sps program infers, in  itself, the successful development of a number of space-based technologies that  should lead to widely expanding use of space by the private sector. the transition  from federal funding to private sector funding for space activities is already  evident with communications and information satellite programs, and the accelera-  tion of these trends due to improved space transportation technologies is clearly  forthcoming. the successful implementation of an sps program assures that highly  advanced technologies in.low cost space transportation including both earth to leo  and leo to ceo will have been successfully developed. in addition, technologies  for the construction and deployment of large-scale space structures, long duration  manned facilities and low cost solar cells are assured. these technologies will be  available by about the year 2000, or at the time of implementation of the sps  system, and will thus contribute to the economic development of space in the  intervening period (2000 to 2030).  at the present time the private sector is making significant strides forward  in space-based activities with a focus on communications and data gathering.  present communications activities in the private sector include not only comsat  (a quasi-private sector organization) but a number of u.s. corporations such as  western electric, rca, ibm and so on. these activities should begin to mature  around the year 2000 with the implementation of large communications platforms  in geosynchronous orbit. both these and lower altitude platforms will also probably  be implemented by the private sector for data collection. the data collection  systems will include both natural resources and environment monitoring such as the  landsat and seasat satellites have done to date. it is conceivable that the  communications industry alone could grow to a level of expenditure of between \\', \\'19  $15 billion and $100 billion per year by the year 2060, and that data collection  activities would be on the order of $10 billion to $100 billion per year by that time.  space-based communications expenditures are likely to grow in order ‘to  handle personal communications, business data transfer and video communications  including teleconferencing. the advantages of teleconferencing in business appli-  cations are fast becoming apparent and this mode of communication is likely to  supplant a significant fraction of business travel. it is an interesting aside to note  that advanced communications activities such as this are highly energy conserva-  tive. by the year 2060 it is conceivable that between 30 and 60 large communica-  tions platforms will be in place, many in geosynchronous equatorial orbit, but some  in other orbits to serve more extreme latitudes. the present desire for geo-  stationary satellites is clearly shown in figure 2.1. by the year 1990 some 150  satellites will have served various functions, mostly communications, in that orbit.  figure 2.1 geostationary satellites--to date and planned \\', \\'20  as data collection in space becomes an economic reality, it is rapidly found  that satellites can produce prodigious quantities of data. a single advanced earth  resources satellite, for example, might produce as much as lo9 bits of data per  second. clearly, no human will ever examine all of the available data. thus it is  reasonable to expect a substantial amount of space-based data processing in order  to reduce these data to an informational level upon which decisions can be based.  space-based data processing in large (by current standards) computers, co-located  with the data collection sensors in space, thus enabling the communications link  with earth to carry minimal amounts of processed data, is likely.  an intriguing and totally unpredictable area of space activity is space-based  manufacturing. space, of course, offers a unique environment including high  vacuum and zero gravity which should be of considerable benefit to particular  manufacturing processes. the unfortunate fact at this time is that since this  environment has heretofore not been available to the private sector, the tech-  nology for using it has not been developed. as a result, to date, nasa and others  have studied a variety of products that might potentially be manufactured in space  and found that indeed there may be benefits in doing so. unfortunately there is a  considerable time lag between today and the date at which commercial space-  based manufacturing facilities will be available to the private sector. thus the  principal conclusion to which one might arrive is that there are many potential  products that could be beneficially manufacturered in space, but none of them are  the products that have been examined to date, nor are they products that one  would choose to manufacture in space based upon what is known today. accord-  ingly the annual expenditures on space-based manufacturing is highly uncertain at  this time. conceivably they could be as low as a fraction of a percent or as high  as possibly 10 percent of the gross national product, say a range of $10 billion to  $500 billion per year. \\', \\'21  the third major category of private sector activity in space is energy. if sps  is implemented, these expenditures will be quite high. for example, the operation  and maintenance expense on a fleet of 60 sps satellites will be on the order of $30  billion per year. capital construction of new sps satellites could add another $20  . billion to $50 billion or more to this amount. worldwide implementation of sps on  a large scale plus construction of space-based energy systems for lunar exploration,  asteriod retrieval and space habitation could increase this amount to as much as  $250 billion per year.  in addition to the above four categories of space-based activities, there are a  number of other activities that are likely to occur in space. these include physics  and astronomy, solar system exploration, basic and applied research, space tourism,  space-based navigation systems and so on. these miscellaneous activities are  likely to involve expenditures in the range of $5 billion to $50 billion per year by  the year 2060. summing these figures as shown in figure 2.2, the private sector  potential activities in space range from a low of about $65 billion per year in the  year 2060 to a high of about $1 trillion per year.  annual  expenditure  on space,  19806  nasa  dod  1980 2060  year private sector potential  energy $25- 2508  comm . 15-100  data 10-100  &an. lo-

space-based activities, if such growth indeed occurs between now and the  year 2060, will derive mainly from private sector ventures undertaken because they  are economic. the challenge to nasa is to focus space programs between now and  the year 2000 in such a way as to promote the economic utilization of space.  given the proper opportunities, it is conceivable that as much as 20 percent of the  gross national product in the year 2060, or say $1 trillion per year, will be derived  from space-based activities. on the other hand, without proper encouragement and  technology development from nasa and other government agencies, this amount  could be very much smaller and the government could still dominate annual  expenditures on space activities as late as the year 2060.  2.1 the period 2000 to 2030  in the context of the above discussion, it is possible to make useful  observations on space-based activities during the period 2000 to 2030. a principal  activity in space during this period will quite clearly be space-based communica-  tions, data collection and data processing. it is also evident that the current trend  of placing an ever increasing number of relatively small satellites in geosyn-  chronous orbit cannot continue. communications and data needs will be satisfied  in the future by the use of large geosynchronous platforms rather than by a number  of smaller satellites. accordingly the following general trends are identified for  the post-2000 time period:  1. space will be populated with fewer larger spacecraft. this will be  accomplished by transition to large mutli-purpose platforms.  2. bandwidth limitations will be overcome by using higher power levels  and spot beams.  3. multi-purpose platforms will not be co-located with sps due to con-  flicting requirements such as the potential need for turning sps  satellites out of the sun during maintenance periods. \\', \\'23  4. mutli-purpose platforms will occupy many important orbits, not only  geo.  5. on-orbit servicing capability will be maintained for all multi-purpose  platforms. because of their high value, downtime on these platforms  will be extremely expensive. the balance between man and robotics for  providing on-orbit servicing capability is very uncertain at this time.  6. many activities in space will be internationally sponsored, and it is  likely that large geosynchronous platforms will be considered multi-  national territory.  7. many of the activities performed in space in the post-2000 period will  be performed there because it is economic to do so independent of  government funding. these activities will thus represent a significant  transformation of space-based activities from the government to the  private sector.  8. a fully reusable space transportation system and multi-purpose plat-  forms will dramatically lower the cost of the space activities and thus  promote increasing private sector investments in space.  9. system complexity will shift from the ground segment where it is  presently to the space segment, enabling ground-based users to partici-  pate in the use of space-based communications and data collection with  relatively low investment. however this does not infer that the  majority of expenditures on a particular system will be on the space  segment. to the contrary, the lowering of costs for ground-based users  is likely to increase the number of ground-based users dramatically, thus  maintaining the preponderance of expenditures on the ground segment.  for example, if the worldwide market for personal communicators at  $100 per communicator is 100 million units, a total expenditure on the  ground,segment of some $10 billion will ensue. this might be compared  to an expenditure on the space segment in support of these communi-  cators of, say, $5 billion.  of particular interest in the post-2000 time period are geosynchronous  platforms. it has already been observed that geosynchronous orbit will be  dominated by large platforms during this period. the seeds of this transformation  have already been sown, and it is expected that during the late 80s and early 90s a  number of u.s. domestic and intelsat platforms in the 25 kilowatt class will be  placed in geosynchronous orbit. during the period of the mid-90s to about the year  2010, the placement of some five to ten larger platforms in the 100 to 500 kw class is  likely. beyond the year 2010 one can look for the replacement of the earlier \\', \\'24  platforms by a new class of platforms in the 1 to 5 mw class, growing to a total of  some 15 to 30 platforms by the year 2030. the larger platforms are likely to be  manned either by robots or by two-man crews rotated periodically. the purpose’of  man will be to effect immediate service, repair and maintenance as necessary to  keep the platform properly functioning. the cost of the advanced platforms will be  in the range of $2 billion to $10 billion each, and they will have a structure and  power supply life approaching 50 years with other systems being updated on about a  ten-year cycle.  the advanced geosynchronous platforms will be supported by a manned  geosynchronous facility which is also likely to be a space-based manufacturing  facility to manufacture and rebuild components and subsystems for the geosyn-  chronous and other space platforms. as a result it is likely that 50 to 500 persons  will be stationed in geosynchronous orbit in support of the geosynchronous  platforms.  spacecraft power and lifetime trends to date, as shown in figure 2.3, clearly  reflect these trends. twenty-five kw platforms are presently in the planning  stage* and studies on 100 to 500 kw platforms for the late 1990s time period have  ++  already been performed. the continuing improvements in lifetime and growth in  power levels shown in figure 2.3 are fully compatible with sps-based technologies.  it is interesting to consider the traffic necessary to support the geosyn-  chronous platforms that are likely to be put in place in the 2000 to 2030 period.  *  payloads requirements/accommodations assessment study for science and

which need to be  transported to geosynchronous orbit. the first class involves durable goods such as  the materials for construction of new platforms. it is probably economic to  transport these materials between leo and ceo using a low-thrust electric cargo  orbit transfer vehicle (cotv). the implications in this decision indicate that the  cost of capital for the durable goods during the period of transportation is more  than offset by the cost savings afforded by the electric cotv. nondurable goods,  however, such as man and his logistics, require more rapid forms of transportation.

the use of a chemical potv could be quite  advantageous.  2.2 the post-2030 time period  very little more can be said about space activities in the post-2030 time  period than has been noted already above. it is likely that this period will see the  widespread use of space by man including space habitation and utilization of  extraterrestrial resources. it is also likely that many scientific endeavors will move  into space: astrophysics, astronomy, high-energy physics and biological research \\', \\'27  are examples. it is this context in which salvage value of sps satellites was  considered. \\', \\'28  3. sps demonstration satellite salvage alternatives  according to the rockwell international sps development program. plan,* the  completion of the sps technology advancement phase by 1990 will provide the  technical confidence to proceed with a pilot plant demonstration phase. the  primary objective of this development phase would be the demonstration of all sps  technologies to those utility firms and consortiums that would ultimately capitalize  and operate the production or full scale operational system.  the pilot-plant or demonstration satellite will be constructed in low earth  orbit using a heavy lift launch vehicle (hllv) for mass transportation and  construction support systems. the demonstration satellite will be transferred to  geosynchronous orbit by an on-board electric propulsion system. the demonstra-  tion satellite will operate in the same mode as the full-scale sps satellite by  directing a microwave power beam at a total power level of a few hundred mw to a  standard modular segment of the proposed operational ground rectenna. the  demonstration/operational period may range from six months to a few years, during  which time the sps elements of the full-scale solar power satellite will be operated  in the operational environment. operational data will provide the quantitative  basis for analyses which will support full sps commercial capability.  the initial step will be to establish a base in low-earth orbit that is capable  of constructing the demonstration satellite. the demonstrator satellite, shown near  completion in figure 3.1, is sized to the projected electric orbit transfer vehicle  (eotv) power level of 335 mw at the array. allowing for radiation degradation  *satellite power systems (sps)

rectenna, resulting in recovery of 8 h4w of power for a sparsely  populated 7-km-diameter demonstration rectenna or 2 mw of power for a 1.7%km  demonstration rectenna.  the demonstration satellite is

satellite and the  associated transportation costs and the on-orbit capability that will exist, there is \\', \\'.w i -n-m - .__. --.-- _- .._. ----  figure 3.2 full-scale operational sps satellite configuration  (source: rockwell international)  a natural concern as to the alternative uses of the demonstration satellite upon  completion of the demonstration program, and the economic value associated with  these uses. the following sections discuss alternative uses, and the value derived  therefrom, to which the demonstration satellite may be put upon completion of the  demonstration program. four alternative uses have been considered, namely:  1. use of the demonstration satellite as the first building-block of the first full-  scale sps satellite. the economic value, or salvage value, of the demonstra-  tion satellite derives primarily from the costs which would be foregone in the  construction of the full-scale satellite through the incorporation of the  demonstration satellite into the full-scale satellite.  2. use of the demonstration satellite as a source of power for non-sps space  activities. this use requires the systematic disassembly of the demonstration  satellite and transferral and use of the disassembled power subsystems as  power supplies in other space missions. here the salvage value of the  demonstration satellite derives primarily from the costs (both hardware and  associated transportation) foregone by the other space missions through their  use of the demonstration satellite power subsystems. \\', \\'- -  table 3.1 dewonstration

foregone by using the basic materials existing in the demon-  stration satellite.  3.1 growth to full-scale satellite  it is currently envisioned that the demonstration satellite will consist of an  energy conversion segment, an interface segment and a power transmission  segment. the energy conversion segment will consist of primary and secondary  structure, concentrators, solar blankets, switchgear and converters, conductors and  insulation, attitude control and information management subystems. the interface  segment includes the primary and secondary structure, mechanisms, conductors/in-  sulation and slipring brushes. the power transmission segment will be representa-  tive of the full-scale satellite antenna to the extent of using identical components.  it will include structures, transmitter subarrays, power distribution and condition-  ing, batteries, insulation and phase control elements.  current plans call for growth of the demonstration satellite into the first  full-scale sps satellite. by growing the demonstration satellite into the first full-  scale satellite, certain costs may be foregone (that is, a cost item that would have  to be incurred if the demonstration satellite were not available for use, would not  be incurred since the demonstration satellite & available for use) whereas others  may be incurred. the present value of the net of these costs referenced to the  initial operation date of the demonstration satellite, is the salvage value that may  be derived from this use of the demonstration satellite. it is assumed throughout  the following that the demonstration satellite is in orbit and all associated ddt&e  and first unit costs are sunk. \\', \"-  34  the salvage value of the demonstration satellite when used as an initial  element in a full-scale satellite is summarized in figure 3.3 and discussed below.  the salvage value, sv, is  sv = pvi + pv2 - pv3 - pv4  wheie pvi is the present value of the full-scale satellite costs that may be  foregone. pvl accounts for the hardware costs for providing a capability  equivalent to the demonstration satellite capability and the transportation costs  associated with transporting this equivalent capability. the demonstration satel-  lite capability must be adjusted for degradation effects which are a function of  time (the time interval to the deployment of the first full-scale satellite) and both  hardware and transportation costs must be adjusted for learning effects (assumed  to be a function of time) that may also take place during this interim period. pv2  is the present value of consumer surplus benefits that will result if the marginal  value of  sv- sps det40 =  i i satellite \\'resent vmue of initial investment foregone  a space

consumer surplus benefits are directly proportional to the price  differential, the energy produced and the time interval from demonstration  completion to on-orbit construction of the operational satellite. pv3 is the present  value of possible increases in construction (interface) costs that result from not  being able to take advantage of knowledge gained from the demonstration program.  pv4 is the present value of the increase in demonstration satellite investment cost  to achieve the same reliability characteristics that would be achieved by the first  full-scale operational satellite. since no information is available on demonstration  satellite cost in terms of reliability characteristics, pv4 has been assumed to be  zero. the detailed value model is indicated below together with definitions of the  variables and the nominal values utilized in the analysis. it should be noted that  the annual transportation investment cost is treated parametrically and is obtained  by spreading the cost to deliver 1.618 x lo6 kg to geosynchronous orbit over a three  year period (30%, 40% and 30% respectively). the basic range of transportation  cost has been considered from 0 to 100 $/kg predicated upon the assumption that  10~ transportation costs will have to be achieved in order to proceed with an  economically viable full-scale operational sps system.  pv 1 = (iod-ioc)l1

demonstration satellite is indicated as a function of transportation  cost ($/kg) and the time interval between the initial operations dates of the full-  scale operational satellite and the demonstration satellite. the basic conclusion  that may be reached from the data presented in figure 3.4 is that the salvage value  ($l.l-$1.7 billion) of the demonstration satellite may be a large percentage of the  demonstration satellite on-orbit cost (first unit plus transportation cost). the  salvage value may be in the range of 60-90 percent of the on-orbit cost of the  demonstration satellite depending upon transportation cost achieved and the time  interval from demonstration satellite operations to operation of the first full-scale  sps satellite.  3.2 demonstration satei+

demand for space power in  the 2000 to 2030 time frame, the demand has been treated parametrically in terms  of mw required per year. this demand has been considered in the range of 1 to  15 mw/yr as illustrated by the solid lines in figure 3.5. the dashed curve in  figure 3.5 indicates the avaiiable supply, taking into account a l%/yr degradation in  power and an assumed inefficiency (25% salvage

indicates the salvage value (present value) of the demonstration sate!lite when the i  demonstration satellite is used as a source of power for other space activities such  as ge0 platforms, manufacturing bases, otv or space exploration vehicles. the  salvage value is shown as a function of the annual demand for space power and the  cost of earth to ge0 transportation. it can be seen that the salvage value is not  materially impacted by transportation costs but is directly related to demand  (mw/yr). at very high demand levels the salvage value can approach $150 -  170 million and at a demand level of less than 1.5 mw/yr the salvage value is zero.  it is possible that other major (nonpower) subsystems such as slip-  rings, mechanisms, transmitter subarray and switchgear and converters will be  salvageable for other space missions. figure 3.8 illustrates the salvage value of  the sps demonstration satellite when the power supply and several other major  subsystems are salvageable. the salvage value is shown as a function of annual  demand for power, the cost of earth-ge0 transportation and the time (relative to  2000) at which the nonpower subsystems are salvaged.*

salvage value may approach as much as $200 million when other  subsystems are salvaged and the demand for power is low.  3.3 power supply for a laser orbit-to-orbit transportation system  table 2.1 shows that whether or not the sps program moves into an  implementation phase, there is likely to be a substantial level of leo to ceo  traffic. a considerable fraction of this traffic will include man and logistics and  must be transported relatively quickly, thus prohibiting the use of low thrust,  electrically propelled orbit transfer vehicles. the presently planned mode for  providing leo to ceo transportation of personnel and logistics is to use a chemical  rocket personnel orbit transfer vehicle (potv). as table 2.1 shows, the propellant  requirements for the chemical potv are considerable. these propellants must be  transported from earth to leo. the implementation of a laser space transporta-  tion system with a specific impulse of 2,000 s could reduce the propellant mass  requirements by about 72 percent.*  assuming that propellant costs remain constant, and that the potv capital  cost and per flight maintenance costs are approximately equal for both the  chemical and laser configurations, the principal benefit attributable to a laser  space transportation system will be derived by means of cost savings in earth to  leo transportation of propellants. furthermore, it is likely that the cost of  transportation from earth to leo will depend upon whether or not the sps program  proceeds into an implementation phase. since transportation costs are a major  fraction of total sps capital costs, the transportation costs are likely to be low if  forced by sps technology development. they are likely to be significantly higher if  sps is not implemented thus alleviating much of the need to achieve low  *  laser rocket system analysis, final report, lockheed missiles and space  company, inc., nasa cr-159521, september 1978. \\', \\'47  transportation costs. at the same time, the demand placed upon a laser space  transportation system will be very much higher if the sps program proceeds into an  implementation phase than if it does not. thus the fact that the sps program is  likely to result in technologies leading to reduced launch costs, and thus to reduce  benefits for a laser space transportation system, is substantially offset by the  increased traffic that implementation of the sps would cause. accordingly the  benefits of a laser space transportation system are evaluated using as a baseline  the leo to ceo potv traffic model identified in table 2.1. earth to leo  transportation costs are assumed to be $70 per kg. a second case is also  considered using an earth to leo transportation cost of $800 per kg representative  of an advanced space shuttle or shuttle derivative vehicle.  to compute a salvage value for this use it is necessary to determine year-by-  year savings achieved by the laser space transportation system. to obtain a leo  to ge0 traffic model year by year during the period 2000 to 2030, it is assumed  that the lower bound of the transportation requirements given in table 2.1 apply to  the year 2000 and the upper bound apply to the year 2030, and that traffic growth  between these years is linear as shown in figure 3.9. the present value of savings  obtained by this traffic model, at a 4 percent discount rate, is equal to 83.8 times  the year 2000 savings.  the present value of the demonstration satellite in this use for the baseline  case with transportation costs of $70 per kg is $1.68 billion, and at $800 per kg  transportation costs to leo is $19.27 billion. these numbers, of course, are likely  to apply if the sps program does not proceed into an implementation phase. if the  .sps program proceeds into an implementation phase, the benefit from this salvage  value would be very much larger. thus it is clear that it is desirable to devleop and  implement the laser space transportation system independent of the sps program. \\', \\'48  0 i  2000 2030  figure 3.9 leo to ge0 traffic growth  since the laser sps configuration is presently under consideration, it would  appear an interesting option to include a laser power transmitter on the demonstra-  tion satellite such that demonstration tests for both the microwave and laser sps  configurations could be performed with the demonstration satellite and such that,  upon completion of these tests, the satellite could be easily converted to use as a  power supply and laser power transmitter for a laser space transportation system.  these arguments are reinforced by the fact that the benefits of a laser space  transportation system are of sufficient magnitude to warrant its development even  if an sps demonstration satellite is not constructed.  since the benefits of a laser space transportation system are likely to exceed  the costs of the sps demonstration, the salvage value of the demonstration  satellite in this use is equal to the present value of a power supply for a laser space  transportation system, discounted from the initial date of operation of the laser  space transportation system to the initial operation date of the sps demonstratjon  satellite. if this time period is very short, the salvage value of the demonstration  satellite becomes approximately equal to the cost of the demonstration program  less the cost of the microwave transmitting antenna and associated systems. these  equipments, however, could be salvaged for use on the first full-scale sps satellite, \\', \\'49  provided that the program enters an implementation phase.  3.4 source of space-based materials  a potential use of the sps demonstration satellite is as a source of materials  conveniently located in geosynchronous orbit. in this salvage use the demon-  stration satellite would be cut up into small sections, possibly melted down and  reused as raw materials for space-based manufacturing processes. this salvage use  is considered in more detail in section 4.6 relative to full-scale sps satellites. it is  found that the value of the raw materials which make up the demonstration  satellite is relatively small, roughly on the order of $157 million. the fact that  these materials are located in geosynchronous orbit, however, adds an incremental  value of about $50 million (at sps transportation costs, 50,08o$/mt), bringing their  on-orbit value up to approximately $217 million. unfortunately not all of the  materials contained in the demonstration satellite would be salvageable. the  majoi items in question include sapphire and gaas. these materials alone  constitute about 63 percent of the total on-orbit value. thus if they are not  salvageable, the on-orbit value of the sps materials decreases to about $81 million.  even so, much of this value is made up of materials which are not likely to be  easily salvaged for use as raw materials in manufacturing processes.  because of the relatively low value that the demonstration satellite has as a  source of raw materials in space, this is not a very desirable salvage option.  furthermore, the return of these materials to earth for reuse would, in all  likelihood, cost substantially more than their value on earth. \\', \\'50  4. full-scale sps satellite salvage alternatives  starting in the year 2001 and continuing through the year 2030, two full-scale’  sps satellites will become operational each year in addition to a full-scale sps  satellite becomming operational in the year 2000. the full-scale satellite  characteristics are summarized in tables 1.1 and 3.2. current plans call for these  satellites remaining in operation for a period of 30 years at which time they will be  taken out of service. when this occurs it is likely that major portions of the full-  scale satellites will prove useful in other space activities. the full-scale sps  satellites will thus have a salvage value that is related to their value when used in  other space activities. the salvage value, as measured by costs that will be  foregone because of the use of full-scale sps satellites, will derive from the use of  the full-scale satellites:  1. in a continuing sps program (termed “sps reuse”)  2. as a source of power for non-sps space activities  3. as a power supply for a laser orbit-to-orbit transportation system  4. as a power supply for laser propelled aircraft  5. as a source of power for accomplishing asteroid capture and mining  6. as a source of space-based materials.  these potential uses and the derived salvage value of the full-scale satellites are  discussed in the following paragraphs.  4.1 salvage for sps reuse  the full-scale operational satellite consists of a power generation system  utilizing gallium aluminum arsenide (caalas) solar cells with a concentration ratio  of two; an attitude control/station keeping system utilizing argon ion thrusters; a \\', \\'51  power distribution system consisting of switchgear and converters; conductors and  insulation; structure; a microwave power transmission system including waveguides  and klystrons for converting dc to rf energy; a structure system comprised of  aluminum and graphite fiber reinforced thermal plastic and an information  management system. the components, subsystems and systems are designed such  that 5 gw of power are delivered at the utility interface. to accomplish this in an  economic manner, certain systems are designed to achieve a life of 30 years (for  example, the graphite structure), whereas other systems may achieve shorter  useful lives and must be maintained and/or replaced periodically during the 30 year  life of the full-scale satellite (for example, the klystrons will be replaced at ten  year intervals). it is obvious that such a complex system will not completely  deteriorate instantaneously at the end of 30 years but will continue to function in a  degrading fashion for some time beyond its design life. thus certain systems may  be salvageable for use in other full-scale sps operational satellites or a full-scale  satellite may continue to be utilized beyond its 30 year nominal life. the actual  life, including specific maintenance/replacement policies, will be determined as a  result of the overall system economics, evolving design and design philosophy, and  operational procedures all of which have been considered in insufficient detail at  this time to specifically establish which components/subsystem/system mainte-  nance/repair procedures and policies* will be accomplished and which com-  ponents/subsystems/systems will be economically salvageable.  +  it should be noted that these policies and procedures will be a function of  technology and improvements in reliability. for example, if klystrons have a  ten-year life, then they will be replaced twice and have little salvage value  at the end of 30 years. if, however, klystrons achieve a 14-year life, the sps  satellite may have a 28-year life with one klystron replacement, or it may  have a 30-year life with economically salvageable klystrons (for other sps  satellites). \\', \\'52  the salvage value of reuse of components of a, full-scale sps satellite  depends upon which specific components, subsystems and systems are available for  reuse at the end of the 30-year life of the satellite. to determine specifically  which l’piecesvv will be available requires a detailed reliability/replacement/repair  analysis which has not yet been accomplished.  in the absence of such an analysis only a rough estimate of value may be  accomplished by considering the value of extending the useful life of a full-scale  satellite. the value of extending the useful life may be established as the  difference in the present value of the cost of a series of full-scale satellites which  become operational at 30-year intervals and the present value of the cost of a  series of full-scale satellites which become operational at 30 + at year intervals.  with a real discount rate of 4 percent, a one year (at = 1) increase in life  corresponds to a salvage value of 2-3 percent of the satellite cost. this increases  to 17 percent of the satellite cost when at = 10 years.  4.2 power supply for non-sps space activities  in the same manner that the demonstration sps satellite was viewed as a  potential source of power (335 mw) for other space activities, so may the full-scale  satellite be considered as a potential source’ of power (9.52 cw) for other space  activities. the salvage value will depend upon the demand for power created by  other space activities. the supply of power will be incremented by up to 19 gw  per year, starting in the year 2030, and decremented by the rate of degradation of  the power supplies. since a mission model for non-sps activities cannot be  established for the mid-21st century, it is not reasonable to compare supply and  demand (as was done for the demonstration sps satellite--see section 3.2) to  establish the salvage value in terms of the demand for space power satisfied by the  sps satelites. it is likely, however, that the supply will far exceed the demand. at \\', \\'53  an annual (new capacity) demand growth of 15 mw/yr, a maximum of 450 mw will  be supplied by an sps satellite if it lasts 30 years beyond its useful life. since this is  but a small percentage of the.design power level of the full-scale satellite, it may  be concluded that the salvage value derived from this use will be a small  percentage of the cost of one full-scale sps satellite.  4.3 power supply for a -to-orbit transportation system  as in the case of the demonstration satellite, an interesting potential salvage  use of full-scale sps satellites is as a power supply for a laser orbit-to-orbit  transportation system. the economics of this use are quite similar to the  demonstration satellite case; however, the full-scale satellite provides some 30  times more power and would thus be appropriate for use with much larger and  higher payload vehicles. the benefits of this salvage use are strongly dependent  upon geocentric traffic in the post-2030 period. they could be considerable if  there are massive manned activities in space, such as large manufacturing bases,  space habitats and so on. alternatively the benefits could be quite small if the  traffic remains relatively small. at this point in time the only traffic that would  clearly exist beyond that noted in table 2.1 is the traffic necessary to support the  construction and maintenance of the sps fleet. this traffic, as envisioned by  rockwell international, would involve on the order of 150 potv flights per year or  one every other day. this level of traffic can be supported by a power supply  which is on the order of hundreds of megawatts rather than gigawatts. the  advantage of a multi-gigawatt system would be to allow higher thrust levels,  possibly higher specific impulse and possibly to provide power for ascent from  earth-to-leo. unless the earth to leo traffic becomes a major factor, or unless  it becomes desirable to station satellites to provide a capability for continuous or  unconstrained thrusting, it does not appear that this salvage use will require more \\', \\'54  than one full-scale sps satellite. because of the speculative nature of the benefits  resulting from this salvage use, they are not quantified further.  4.4 power supply for laser-propelled aircraft  it has been proposed by researchers at the university of washington and  lockheed missiles and space company that space-based lasers be used to power  aircraft on transoceanic flights.* conceptually, oceanic flights would be con-  ducted by means of conventional kerosene-powered jet engines for takeoff and  climb to altitude. upon reaching altitude, at some point over the ocean, the  kerosene combustors would be shut down and the aircraft provided energy from a  laser beam originating in space. energy in the laser beam would be intercepted by  a laser receiver mounted on the top of the aircraft and used as thermal energy to  power turbofan engines. upon descent the laser power would be discontinued and  the use of kerosene resumed.  it seems reasonable to base projections of the demand for power by oceanic  aircraft on the assumption that the number of oceanic flights beyond the year 2030  is equal to the current number of oceanic flights. it is furthermore reasonable to  assume that all aircraft in the oceanic regions at that point in time will be  comparable to current ‘heavy aircraft such as the dc-10 and 747. table 4.1  summarizes the current oceanic air traffic. there are presently about 3000  aircraft-hours spent in the oceanic sectors each day.  the power requirements of a wide-bodied aircraft are typified by the 747 and  dc- 10. the 747 burns an average of about 24,000 pounds per hour of fuel at cruise  and the dc-10 17,000 pounds per hour. these numbers correspond to power levels  of 133.6 mw thermal and 94.6 mw thermal respectively. thus the average energy  hertzberg, abraham, kenneth sun and wayne jones, laser aircraft, astro-  nautics and aeronautics, march 1979, pp. 41-49. \\', \\'55  table 4.1 current oceanic air traffic  region flig,hts/day hrs/flight  north atlantic

hours/day  consumption across the day is at the rate of about 15 gw. assuming a peak to  average power ratio of 2, it follows that the peak energy consumption rate is about  30 gw. further assuming an “end-to-end” efficiency (power into the jet engine  divided by power into the laser power transmission system) of 20 percent, 30 gw of  thermal energy at the aircraft requires an input of 150 gw to the laser power  transmission systems in space. thus to service this level of traffic will require 17  or more full-scale sps satellites, depending upon the extent to which they have  degraded at the time of salvage.  the next step is to consider the economics of this salvage use. taking the  cost of jet fuel to be $1.00 per gallon (roughly the present price paid by oceanic  aircraft), the cost of the thermal energy derived from this fuel is 23.5 mills/kwh.  it is this number which must be compared to the cost of sps-supplied energy.  taking the oneration and maintenance cost for the sps. in the salvage mode, to be  $200 million per year (note that in this salvage mode it is not necessary to continue  to refurbish the microwave power transmission system) and assuming that each \\', \\'56  satellite is used at 50 percent of capacity (corresponding to a peak to average load  ratio of 21, each satellite provides roughly 40.3 x 10’kwh per year. this results in a  marginal cost of energy at the satellite bus bar of 5.0 mills/kwh. again, using the  20 percent conversion/transmission efficiency, the cost of laser-delivered energy is  about 25.0 mills/kwh. thus it appears that, at the present price of jet fuel, this  salvage use does not have economic benefit.  on the other hand, however, it is likely that the cost of jet fuel will continue  to inflate at a rate which is somewhat above the level of general inflation. thus it  becomes interesting to consider the potential benefit of this salvage use at inflated  jet fuel costs. if all oceanic aircraft shown in table 4.1 made use of laser energy  on the oceanic segment, a total 1.3 x 1011 kwh of energy would be supplied each  year to these aircraft from sps satellites. taking an infinite horizon benefit  approach and a 4 percent discount rate, this would yield a cost saving benefit of  $3.3 billion (net present value referenced to the date at which the system is fully  operational) per mill/kwh cost savings obtained by the use of sps power over jet  fuel. this breaks down to a benefit of $193 million per satellite.  to continue the above example, if the price of jet fuel escalates to a level of  $2 per gallon (1977 dollars), the benefit becomes $4.2 billion per satellite.  assuming that salvage to this use would occur at the end of the satellite% nominal  30-year lifetime, the salvage value thus becomes this $4.2 billion amount  discounted back to the initial operation date of the satellite (30 years). accord-  ingly the salvage value for this use, assuming $2 per gallon jet fuel, is $1.3 billion  per satellite.  it is interesting to note as an aside that this sps satellite salvage use would  make use of orbital positions over the ocean as opposed to over the continents and  thus would not conflict with operational sps satellites. \\', \\'57  4.5 asteroid capture and mining  it has been proposed by brian o’leary* that amor and apollo asteroids could  be captured and placed into earth orbit to provide a source of raw materials for  various space activities. typical characteristics of amor and apollo asteroids are  shown in table 4.2. the estimated population of these asteroids greater than 100  m in diameter is about 150,000. they are presently being discovered at the rate of 2  to 3 per year. the apollo and amor asteroids appear to be typical of ordinary and  carbonaceous chondrites and contain a number of free metals including nickle, iron,  gold, silver, platinum and so on. they are located in orbits close to that of the  earth and require only about 3 km/s velocity increment for capture.  o’leary proposes the use of a mass driver that is capable of using asteroidial  material to provide the necessary impulse for asteroid capture. this mode of  capture would consume a significant fraction of the asteroid. another mode, that  examined here, proposes the use of argon propellant at 10,000 s specific impulse  and the use of the sps satellite as a power supply to effect asteroid capture. taking  a av of 3 km/s each way and a 100 m diameter asteroid, 1.25 million mt, the  propellant requirements are 2,300 mt outbound and 39,100 mt inbound for a total  of 41,400 mt. using this trajectory mode, a thrust duration of somewhat in excess  of one year is required to impart the av with the asteroid in tow.  the economics of asteroid recovery depend strongly on the materials  contained in the asteroid and the demand for these materials in space. typical  values of iron and nickle contained in a 100 m diameter asteroid are as follows: a  10 percent yield of iron would provide 0.125 million mt with a gross value, at $210  o’leary, brian, mass driver retrieval of earth-approaching asteroids,  presented at the third princeton/aiaa conference on space

of nickle would yield 12,500 mt with a  gross value at $4,590 per mt of $57 million on the earth or $683 million at  geosynchronous orbit. beyond iron and nickle the total value of an asteroid will  depend strongly on the quantities of rare materials which it contains. sizeable  deposits of silver, gold, platinum, rhodium, osmium, etc. could drive the total value  of the asteroid up substantially. but the quantities of these materials likely to be  found in any particular asteroid are highly uncertain at the present time.  conceivably, the value of a 100 m diameter asteroid in geosynchronous orbit could  be as high as $10 billion. however, much lower values are likely, especially due to  the fact that there would not exist an on-orbit demand for all of the metals which  the asteroid contains. \", \\'59  the value of the materials contained in an asteroid located in geosynchronous  orbit must be compared to the cost of recovering the asteroid. the cost of  providing sufficient propellants (assuming the trajectory mode stated) ‘at geosyn-  chronous orbit, is approximately $2.1 billion. it follows that the total cost of an  asteroid recovery mission would be on the order of $2.5 billion to $3 billion.  consequently, if the net on-orbit value of the minerals recovered from the asteroid  is on the order of $7 billion to $8 billion, the net salvage value of sps used for an  asteroid recovery mission would be on the order of $1 billion to $2 billion (after  discounting).  4.6 source of space-based materials  if no salvage uses can be found for a particular sps satellite, its subsystems  or components, that satellite may nonetheless be salvaged as raw materials for use  in space-based manufacturing processes. table 4.3 summarizes the materials  contained in a full-scale sps satellite. while the total value of these materials is  approximately $4.5 billion on the earth, most of this value is contained in the  sapphire and caas which make up the solar array blanket. the major metals  contained in the satellite have a value on earth of only $205 million. in  geosynchronous orbit, accounting for cost of transportation, these materials would  have a value of approximately $1 billion. thus, depending upon the demand for  their use in space, these materials could have reasonably significant salvage value.  however it is unlikely that any but very special materials such as silver could be  economically transported back to earth for terrestrial reuse.  two satellite materials, sapphire and caas, which contain over 60 percent of  the total on-orbit value of sps satellite materials, present an interesting salvage  possibility. thus if there is a demand for them and if they can be economically  processed for reuse in space, they would be of considerable salvage value. if such \\', \"60  table 4.3 value of sps satellite materials--gaas. cr=2  mss unit cost value value at geo*  material metric tons (kt) f/mt $ billions $ millions  6frtp

other space power requirements.  4.7 miscellaneous salvage uses  it is likely that there will be other potential applications of decommissioned  full-scale sps satellites. in the mid-21st century, space industrialization will come  into its own with the need for large space stations, high power and raw materials.  it is also likely that there will be large laboratory facilities (for example, a high  energy physics laboratory) in geosynchronous orbit. it is hard to establish a value  for salvage use of sps satellites for these activities because they do not lead to  economic activities that can be easily evaluated. for example, salvage of an sps  satellite may make the establishment of a high energy physics laboratory in space \", \\'61  viable, but the salvage value of the sps satellite in this use would not equal the  cost savings afforded since the availability of the sps satellite would.enable this  mission, not merely benefit it. accordingly estimates of salvage value for these  uses would be highly speculative and are not included here.  4.8 continued use  an obvious potential use of a 30 year old sps satellite is to simply continue  to use it as an sps satellite. since the satellite would be fully depreciated at this  time, its continued use would provide, in essence, a salvage value. the only thing  which would prevent a satellite from obtaining salvage value from continued use  would be if there is a wearout failure mode for the satellite which occurs shortly  after it has been in use for 30 years. if, on the other hand, the satellite degrades  exponentially with time at a rate 6 then the net salvage value (net of disposal costs  at the end of its economic life) is approximately given by the following equation:  eor  %= pi% 1 (1+/j+ a)l-f - (i+p+a)‘-t ]- com [ - p (i+pp - (l+p)1-t - cd (l+p)-t  3  where eois the beginning-of-life energy produced by the satellite per year, r is the  revenue generated in mills/kwh, t is system age when salvaged in years, com is  the annual operation and maintenance. cost, cd, is the disposal cost and p is the  discount rate. t is the satellite age at the end of its economic life (when revenues  equal marginal operating costs):  t= ldeor/com)  in(l+a)  for typical values of these parameters, figure 4.1 shows the continued-use sps  salvage value. clearly, for degradation rates between 0 and 2 percent, this salvage  use produces a considerable salvage value at t = 30 years. it is also clear, however, \\', \"62  pv of  salvage use  referenced  to iod.  $ billions assumes  i 0  .5 i \\\\\\\\ r = 50

that for degradation rates approaching 5 percent, the sps system will not have an  economic lifetime of 30 years. since rockwell international projects the degrada-  tion rate to be on the order of 0.5 percent per year, the present value of continued  use of the sps, referenced to the initial operation date, will be in excess of $6  billion (conditioned on the assumption that there are no sudden wearout failure  modes).  the notion of continued use can be expanded to verify estimates of salvage  value obtained by direct estimation techniques, such as those employed in the  sections above. this can be done by examining the decision to decommission an  sps satellite. at any point in time there are essentially five options: to continue  operation of the satellite; to discontinue operation and dispose of the satellite; to  discontinue operation, dispose of the satellite and replace it with a new satellite;  to discontinue operation and salvage the satellite; or to discontinue operation, \", \\'63  salvage the satellite and replace it with a new satellite. this decision and the  values associated with each alternative are shown in figure 4.2. r refers to the  annual revenues generated by continued use of the satellite, com is the annual  operation and’maintenance cost as above, cdis the cost of disposal, cr is the cost  of replacing the satellite, vs is the salvage value of the satellite and pv(*) refers  to present value. it is desirable to take the choice which has the highest present  value at the date of the decision. the resulting decision rules are shown on the  right side of figure 4.2. thus it becomes apparent that if a decision is made to  salvage the sps satellite, its salvage value should be greater than its continued use  value. this notion, once again, argues for relatively substantial salvage values  associated with annual degradation rates in the range of 0 to 1 percent per year, so  long as there exist no wearout failure modes that will occur shortly after 30 years  of system use.  dispose l replace  continue operation l dispose if  r < cow - cd > vs  l salvage if  r<c @4 + l-g vs’ vs ’ o  or if  r c co,,, vs >-cd  salvage & repuce  pv (

developed the salvage value for the demonstration satellite that  will result from its use as part of a full-scale operational sps satellite, as a source  of power for non-sps space activities, as a power supply for a laser orbit-to-orbit  transportation system and as a source of space-based materials. these applica-  tions of the demonstration satellite are summarized in figure 5.1 which indicates  their relative timing and salvage value.  the laser orbit-to-orbit transportation system utilizes the demonstration  satellite as a power source for a laser space transportation system. the microwave  power transmission system is not needed in this salvage use and is thus available  for use by the first full-scale sps satellite. the salvage value derives primarily  from cost savings in the cost of transporting chemical propellants from earth to  leo for use in leo to ge0 transportation of personnel and logistics. the  considerably higher specific impulse of a laser rocket permits about a 70 percent  reduction in the mass of propellant that must be transported to leo compared to  chemical rockets. the value of the demonstration satellite .when used in this  manner is in excess of $1.7 billion.  if the demonstration program is successful, that is if it is found desirable to  continue the sps program beyond the demonstration phase, the demonstration  satellite can be used as a component of the first full-scale sps satellite. in this  application the demonstration satellite has a salvage value of slightly less than  $1.7 billion. \\', \"dekml\\'rallon satellite

(a  component of this cash flow stream is the present value of the disposal cost, of  $0.03 billion, associated with each satellite that is not salvaged.) there are  26 full-scale satellites that are salvaged over a 30-year period in the indicated  scenario and 34 full-scale satellites that have to be disposed of. the present value  of the “sal’vage value cash flow stream” (at a 4% discount rate) is approximately  $22 billion. an equivalent annuity may be established which over the 30-year time  period (60 satellites) has the same present value as the salvage value cash flow  stream. this annuity, approximately $0.64 billion per satellite or about 6 percent  of the satellite capital cost, corresponds to the average net salvage value per  satellite. it should be noted that this value could increase substantially if salvage  uses are found for the 34 satellites that are disposed of in the scenario presented.  5.3 programmatic implications  there are two significant programmatic implications of positive sps demon-  stration satellite and full-scale satellite salvage values. the first deals with the  salvage value of the demonstration satellite. although the salvage value of the  demonstration satellite is very much smaller than the salvage value of the  full-scale sps satellites, it is probably a more important consideration from a  programmatic standpoint. the second programmatic implication deals with the  effects of salvage value upon the cost of sps-generated electricity and hence on  the perceived benefits that development of the sps concept would provide.  the implications of the demonstration satellite salvage value are shown in  figure 5.2. in advance of performing the demonstration research phase, it cannot  be known that this effort will be successful; that is, that upon completion of the \\', \"69  demo cohierc iali zat ion  cd bsps  (a) program decision tree without salvage pre-demo  phases  ,\\'p/d  laser trans. sys.  lts - \\'p/d -

demonstration satellite  salvage value  demonstration phase it will be decided to commercialize or implement the sps  technology. thus two options may be considered to exist upon completion of the  demonstration phase. these are termination of the sps program and commerciali-  zation or continuation of the sps program into an implementation phase. the  consequences of a termination or stop decision would be that the costs sunk in the  sps program, cp,l, and cl, in figure 5.2, would be lost and the beneifts of  commerialization, b sps, would not be realized. it is only through’the commerciali-  zation phase that the sps development costs would in any way be recovered  (figure 5.2(a)).  on the other hand if the demonstration satellite can be salvaged say, for  example, for use as a power supply for a laser space transportation system, this  salvage use provides a benefit, blts in figure 5.2(b), that directly offsets the sps \", \\'70  development costs, even in the event that the sps program does not continue into  an implementation phase. this effect becomes very dramatic when one reaches  the decision to proceed with the demonstration phase. at this point the net cost of  the demonstration is ct., - blts rather than cd. the difference which the term  blts makes in the decision to pursue the sps concept through the demonstration  phase is profound indeed, especially as the magnitude of blts is on the order of  80 percent of the magnitude of cd.  finally, the salvage value of full-scale sps satellites can have a strong  impact on the perceived benefits of development of the sps concept. for example,  assume that without salvage the levelized cost of power from an sps is  50 mills/kwh. assume also that the cost of power from alternative energy sources  is 55 mills/kwh. one would then perceive that a cost savings benefit to society  would obtain from the use of sps-generated energy versus alternative sources with  a magnitude of 5 mills/kwh.  if, however, the sps has a salvage value equal to 10 percent of its capital  cost, this salvage value will reduce the levelized generation costs for the sps  system by about 5 percent, resulting in a net 50 percent increase in the perceived  benefit of the sps. although it may not be prudent from the point of view of a  regulated utility to reduce its energy rates in accordance with the expected  salvage value for sps, incorporation of this value in the federal government’s  planning process is entirely appropriate. \\', \\'71  6. sps disposal  the principal articles considered for disposal in this study include the sps  demonstration satellite and full-scale satellites. these satellites may be disposed  of either intact or in varying states of disassembly depending upon the extent to  which they are salvaged prior to disposal. the demonstration satellite or sections  of it, if any, will require disposal somewhere in the time period 2000 to 2030.  unsalvaged full-scale sps satellites will require disposal beyond the year 2030.  it is important to consider disposal of sps satellites upon completion of their  useful life and salvage for further use due to the fact that the geosynchronous orbit  is a limited natural resource and must be conserved for important uses. it is  prudent in consideration of sps life cycle costs to acknowledge costs associated  with satellite disposal and consider them as a part of the capital investment in the  sps system. although sps differs from many electric energy systems in that there  appear to be a number of relatively valuable salvage uses, once it has reached the  end of its useful life there is little doubt that at least some of the sps hardware  will require disposal. placing a value on sps disposal costs is in essence a  matter of placing a lower bound on net salvage value. the data presented in this  section should be interpreted accordingly.  6.1 disposal alternatives  unlike terrestrial power plants where disposal infers physical disassembly of  the plant, structures and equipment and recovery of land for alternative uses,  disposal of sps satellites may infer simple removal of those satellites from  geosynchronous orbit to another orbit or location in space where they will not  interfere with other space activities. a number of interesting possibilities exist. \\', \\'72  first, however, it is worth noting that not all disposal options are clearly  distinguishable from salvage. for example, it may be desirable to collect sps  satellites that have reached the end of their useful life at a repository location in  geosynchronous or bit. this location might be co-located with a manufacturing  base that, over an extended period of time, would make use of the sps material.  disposal of sps satellites to a common geosynchronous location is a trivial matter  requiring only a few m/s of velocity increment and which could be accomplished  over a period of one to a few months at very little cost. this disposal option has  been discussed in part in section 4.6 and is not considered further here. the major  disposal options considered here include those shown in table 1.3; l4 or l5,  supra-ceo, moon, heliocentric orbit and earth reentry.  the l4 or lg disposal option is illustrated in figure 6.1. there exists in a two  body gravitational system five points at which gravitational forces and accelera-  tions cancel each other such that an object placed at these positions remains  stationary with respect to both of the major bodies. the five points are referred to  as libration or lagrangian points. points ll, l2 and l3 are unstable in the sense  that if the body placed there is subjected to a small perturbation from the precise  position of the lagrangian point, it will drift away or assume an orbit which  diverges from the lagrangian point. points l4 and l5, sometimes referred to as  the equilatoral lagrangian points, however, are stable. that is to say if an object  is placed near these points, it will tend to orbit stably around the lagrangian point,  at least for extremely long periods of time. thus if sps satellites were disposed  of in these locations, one could expect that they would remain there unattended,  essentially forever. the only qualification to this mode of disposal would be that it  might become desirable to lash together all of the satellites located at each of  these points in order to keep them from bumping violently into each other. since \\', \\'73  figure 6.1 lagrangian points in the earth-moon system  l4 and l 5 are located in the orbit of the moon, the energy required to reach these  point is essentially equal to the energy required to reach the moon.  in tne suprage disposal option it is envisioned that the sps satellite would  be removed from geosynchronous orbit to an orbit which is somewhat higher than  geosynchronous and from which decay or perturbation resulting in interference  witn tile geosynchronous would require a vast period of time (say greater than  10,wo years). orbits lower than ge0 were not considered as a viable disposal  option because of the fact that they would result in disposed sps satellites  snadowillg operational sps satellites. any of a variety of supra-ceo orbits,  however, are open for consideration. the orbit proposed here is two times ceo.  this is an orbit which is substantially removed from ceo but yet one for which the  energy requirements to reach it are modest. \\', \\'74  the third option is considered as a means for removing the sps satellite  permanently from space. in this option the satellite is impacted on the lunar  surface. naturally any such impact would have to be carefully coordinated with  lunar activities at the time of impact. although it might be possible to recover  some of the sps materials after impact, this is not accepted as a realistic benefit  of this mode of disposal at this time.  the fourth disposal option considered is removal of sps satellites to a  heliocentric orbit such as 0.8 au. this option removes the sps satellites  sufficiently far from the earth that they are effectively gone forever. the energy  requirement for this mode of disposal is, of course, dependent upon the heliocentric  orbit into which the satellite is placed.  the final disposal option considered is earth reentry. this disposal option  arouses some amount of interest because of the possibility of recovering some sps  materials for reuse on earth if the reentry can be sufficiently wellcontrolled.  unfortunately, however, this mode of disposal not only requires the highest energy  increment and is, thus, the most expensive disposal option, it probably is not  acceptable due to environmental and risk considerations, especially in light of the  absurd extent to which the skylab reentry risks were escalated in the media.  within each of the above disposal options there exists several suboptions.  the principal suboptions include the trajectory mode and thrust level for the  disposal mission. it is envisioned that the disposal would occur using argon  thrusters at a 10,000 s specific impulse. disposal could be by means of the last  flight of a cotv. the cotv could use its own power supply or it could be  augmented by power provided from the sps satellite. in the event that it uses its  own power, the sps satellite could be disposed of in varying states of salvage  incuding one in which essentially all of the solar arrays have been removed. in the \\', \\'75  event that the satellites are disposed intact, power from the sps satellite can be  used and propellant tankage, controls and thrusters from the cotv could be placed  on the sps satellite to provide the necessary thrust and control. in this mode it ii  likely that one would choose to use equipment that was essentially at the end of its  useful life and was salvaged from a cotv.  the rockwell international cargo orbit transfer vehicle is referred to in their  study* as an electric orbit transfer vehicle (eotv), figure 6.2. it has a dry mass of  1,000 mt and carries 670 mt of propellant. this amount of propellant is sufficient  to impart a velocity increment of 1.9 km/s to the sps satellite. thus, for the  higher energy disposal option, additional propellant tankage will be required. the  rockwell international eotv configuration includes 144 thrusters of which 20 per-  cent are spares. the present specification on these thrusters is a lifetime of  8,000 hours. this is not sufficient to complete a disposal mission that requires  more than 333 days of thrusting time. thus, for some dispsal options, longer  lifetime thrusters or additional spares may be necessary. an alternative to the use  of the eotv thrusters is the use of the attitude control and stationkeeping  thrusters of the sps satellite. sixteen thrusters are located on each corner of the  sps satellite making a total of 64 thrusters. these thrusters provide a total thrust  of 832 newtons at a specific impulse of 13,000 s. combined, these thrusters can  impart an acceleration of about 23 x 10 -6 2 m/s to the sps satellite. at this  acceleration it requires 503 days to obtain a velocity increment of 1 km/s. at this  rate it would require several years to dispose of an sps satellite by means of the  disposal options presented. however, with augmentation from the eotv thrusters,  this period of time is dramatically reduced.  *satellite power systems (sps) concept definition study, final report, vol. i,  executive summary,

thrusts also raises an issue as to specifically which  trajectory mode should be used. due to the very low thrust levels and long  thrusting periods required of electrically propelled vehicles, the trajectory mode  selected for their use generally entails continuous thrusting in geosynchronous  space, resulting in spiral trajectories as those shown in figure 6.3(a). the velocity  increment for such a trajectory is approximately twice that of the optimal, high  thrust or impulsive trajectory mode. by lengthening the mission timing, however,  as shown in figure 6.3(b), thrusting only in the vicinity of periapse and apoapse of  the transfer orbit, it is possible to devise trajectory modes where the velocity  increments required of a low thrust vehicle approach that of the optimal high  thrust transfer. thus one cannot choose a specific velocity increment for the  disposal options presented here as these require further analysis and cost optimiza- \\', \\'77  thrust arc  (no coast)

trajectory modes \\', \\'78  tion. the numbers chosen were conservatively selected at two times the velocity  increment required for an impulsive transfer. thus the velocity increment or av  numbers shown in table 1.3, and subsequently the propellant requirements to  provide those velocity increments, are probably somewhat higher than the amounts  which will be ultimately decided upon. however, this overestimate in cost will be  somewhat offset by the increase in mission operations cost due to the lengthened  disposal mission time resulting from the cost optimization of the trajectory mode.  6.2 disposal costs  there are four principal elements of dispoal costs:  1. the cost of modifications to the sps satellite to ready it for the  disposal mission. these costs include added thrusters, propellant  tankage, controls and so on. depending upon the state of salvage of  the satellite, some structural modifications for adaptation of an eotv  may be necessary.  2. the cost of propellants.  3. the cost of transporting propellants to the sps satellite in geosyn-  chronous orbit.  4. the cost of mission operations.  assuming argon to be the propellant and a specific impulse of 10,000 s,  342 mt of propellant is required for each km/s of velocity increment imparted to a  full-scale sps satellite. the cost of argon is presently $240 per mt thus resulting  in a cost of propellant of $81,960 per km/s of velocity increment imparted to the  satellite.  taking the cost of cargo transportation from earth to ceo to be $50,080 per  mt, the cost of transporting propellants to the sps satellite in ge0 is $17,102,000  per km/s of velocity increment imparted to the satellite.  the cost of modifications to the sps satellite in preparation for the disposal  mission is obviously somewhat variable. a reasonable estimate for this cost can be \\', \\'79  obtained from the assumption that the entire eotv vehicle is used on its last or  20th flight to carry out disposal missions. thus taking one twentieth of the cost of  an eotv, $690 million, an estimate of $34.5 million is obtained for satellite  modifications.  the final cost, that of mission operations, is a time dependent cost. it is  assumed here that the mission operations costs for the disposal mission are equal to  mission operations costs for eotv flights. this amount is $4.8 million per year.  using the eotv thruster packs, it requires about 62 days to impart a velocity  increment of 1 km/s to the sps satellite. thus the mission operations costs,  assuming continuous thrust operation, amount to about $818,000 per kilometer per  second of velocity increment.  combining the above costs leads to a velocity-dependent cost estimating  relationship for sps disposal cost as follows:  disposal cost = $(34.5 + 18.0 av) million.  this cost is given in 1977 dollars, comparable to the sps cost estimates. it is the  cost presented in table 1.3. in order to compare these costs to the satellite capital  investment cost, they must be discounted back to the initial operation date of the  satellite. this discount factor is (1 + p) -l where is the discount rate and l is the  satellite lifetime. taking p = 0.04 and l = 30 years, (1 + p)-~ = 0.308. thus the  present value of disposal costs referenced to the initial operation date of the  satellite are on the order of $30 million or 0.3 percent of the capital cost of the  satellite. \\', \\'80  appendix a  supporting data for value of the demonstration satellite used as  a power source for other activities  a.1 cost of segmenting the demonstrationsatellite-ckws  the sps demonstration satellite is constructed at leo and then flown up to  ceo. the construction requires 120 men in orbit for 15 months with 5-6 months  required for blanket construction. crews are changed every three months. it is  thus necessary to transport 600 men to accomplish the construction.  it is assumed that the major cost associated with segmenting the demonstra-  tion satellite is the transportation cost (earth-ceo-earth) for men and supplies.  it is further assumed that the segmenting can be accomplished at ceo without  transporting the construction facilities from leo to ceo. the efficiency of  segmentation will depend upon the size of the components/subsystems/systems that  are salvaged. since the solar blanket will be constructed in about six months it is  assumed that a total of 240 man-trips will be required to segment the power  supply. therefore:  ckws &transportation cost for 240 men plus supplies  335,000 kw  trans. cost
